While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off to help keep your site under the radar.</p><p>Do remember though, this is <em>not</em> secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared pass-phrase for some very basic privacy.</p><h2 id="invite-your-team">Invite your team </h2><p>Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors &amp; Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em>It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links.

By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p><p>When you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. </p><p>For example you may tag some content with News and other content with Podcast, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/podcast/</code>, respectively.</p><p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Podcast</code> - then it appears in both sections. Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p><h3 id="the-primary-tag">The primary tag</h3><p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. </p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, Technology, Startup</em></blockquote><p>So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add related tags which are less important.</p><h3 id="private-tags">Private tags</h3><p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p><p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, #video</em></blockquote><p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting. </p><blockquote><em>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/api/handlebars-themes/">theme docs</a>.</em></blockquote><h2 id="dynamic-routing">Dynamic routing</h2><p>Dynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to suit your needs. Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and templates. </p><p>You may not want content tagged with <code>News</code> to exist on: <code>example.com/tag/news</code>. Instead, you want it to exist on <code>example.com/news</code> .</p><p>In this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of content on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme to render each content type differently.</p><p>There are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few common examples: </p><ul><li>Setting a custom home page with its own template</li><li>Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently, and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content</li><li>Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by specific authors</li><li>Including dates in permalinks for your posts</li><li>Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like <code>example.com/europe/story-title/</code><br></li></ul><blockquote><em>Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">YAML</a> files.

<p>Today, we&#8217;ll be looking at redirecting users with different roles to different pages after they log in.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row height=&#8221;auto&#8221;][vc_column][us_cta title=&#8221;Sample Code&#8221; color=&#8221;secondary&#8221; btn_label=&#8221;Code&#8221; btn_link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMWhyte%2Fspring-security%2Ftree%2F3.redirect-based-on-role||target:%20_blank|&#8221; btn_style=&#8221;2&#8243; btn_size=&#8221;15px&#8221; btn_icon=&#8221;fab|github&#8221;]The code for this lesson is available on GitHub[/us_cta][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row css=&#8221;%7B%22default%22%3A%7B%22margin-top%22%3A%220px%22%2C%22border-top-width%22%3A%220px%22%2C%22padding-top%22%3A%220px%22%7D%7D&#8221;][vc_column][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]Some files are already set up for you from the previous lesson: <a href="https://www.codenerve.com/spring-security-thymeleaf-extras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring Security &#8211; User Roles and Thymeleaf Extras</a>. Please start here or check out the complete code from the link above.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text el_id=&#8221;mrwhyte&#8221;]
</p><h3>Admin.html</h3>
<p>From our previous example, we have created a new HTML file called Admin.html. This is the page we will redirect admins to when they log in.</p>
<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true ">&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"
      xmlns:sec="http://www.thymeleaf.org/thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity4"&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;codenerve.com - Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Admin&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1 th:inline="text"&gt;Hello [[${#httpServletRequest.remoteUser}]]!&lt;/h1&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;
             Custom administrator page.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;form th:action="@{/logout}" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Sign Out"/&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
<h3>MvcConfig</h3>
<p>Now, to serve the new admin.html page, we must add this page to our MvcConfig.</p>
<p>As with the previous examples, this is done by creating a class, extending WebMvcConfigurerAdapter and overriding the addViewControllers method. This time adding all the earlier pages of our app and the new admin page:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">@Configuration
public class MvcConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    public void addViewControllers(ViewControllerRegistry registry) {
        registry.addViewController("/").setViewName("login");
        registry.addViewController("/index").setViewName("index");
        registry.addViewController("/admin").setViewName("admin");
        registry.addViewController("/login").setViewName("login");
    }
}</pre>
[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
<h3>WebSecurityConfig</h3>
<h5>The Constructor</h5>
<p>In order to decide what to do when different user roles login. We have created a new field of type AuthenticationSuccessHandler. We&#8217;re setting this new configuration bean via constructor injection.</p>
<h5>configure method</h5>
<p>This method is in charge of overriding and configuring HttpSecurity explicitly. From the last example, we have added two lines.</p>
<p>First, we&#8217;ve added a new antMatcher under the authorizeRequests section, and we&#8217;ve told spring security only to allow a user with the &#8216;ADMIN&#8217; role access to all endpoints starting with &#8216;/admin&#8217;:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">.antMatchers("/admin").hasRole("ADMIN")</pre>
<p>Secondly, we&#8217;ve added our CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler under the formLogin section to tell spring security to ask this CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler what to do when a successful login occurs:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">.successHandler(authenticationSuccessHandler)</pre>
<h5>configureGlobal method</h5>
<p>The configureGlobal method is our in-memory registry of users. We&#8217;ve added two users. One with the primary &#8216;USER&#8217; role and the other with the &#8216;ADMIN&#8217; role.</p>
<h5>Full example:</h5>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    private AuthenticationSuccessHandler authenticationSuccessHandler;

    @Autowired
    public WebSecurityConfig(AuthenticationSuccessHandler authenticationSuccessHandler) {
        this.authenticationSuccessHandler = authenticationSuccessHandler;
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers( "/css/**").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/admin").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
                .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .successHandler(authenticationSuccessHandler)
                .permitAll()
                .and()
                .logout()
                .permitAll()
                .and().csrf().disable(); // we'll enable this in a later blog post
    }

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth
                .inMemoryAuthentication()
                .withUser("user").password("pass").roles("USER")
                .and()
                .withUser("admin").password("pass").roles("ADMIN");
    }
}</pre>
[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
<h3>CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler</h3>
<p>As you can see from our sample code below this class implements spring AuthenticationSuccessHandler class and overrides the onAuthenticationSuccess method.</p>
<p>Once a user is successfully logged in, this method is called and within this method, the user&#8217;s role is checked. If the user&#8217;s role is admin we redirect to the &#8216;/admin&#8217; HTTP endpoint otherwise we redirect them to the &#8216;/index&#8217; endpoint.</p>
<p>At this point, our MvcConfig takes over and serves the correct HTML page based on the viewController we created previously.</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">@Configuration
public class CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler implements AuthenticationSuccessHandler {


    @Override
    public void onAuthenticationSuccess(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse, Authentication authentication) throws IOException, ServletException {

        Set&lt;String&gt; roles = AuthorityUtils.authorityListToSet(authentication.getAuthorities());

        if (roles.contains("ROLE_ADMIN")) {
            httpServletResponse.sendRedirect("/admin");
        } else {
            httpServletResponse.sendRedirect("/index");
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>To run the demo, open the <em>Application</em> class and right-click run. To start the example, port 8080 will need to be available on your machine. If it is not, you can change this default in the application.properties file using:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">server.port=8081</pre>
<p>Set this to whatever value you wish.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_video link=&#8221;https://youtu.be/jTku174kytg&#8221; video_title=&#8221;1&#8243;][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/color-conifer-environment-192136.jpg" alt="Spring Security - User Roles and ThymeLeaf Extras"><p>In this series, I hope to show you some techniques for using spring security and the broader spring ecosystem to build and develop secure application web servers.</p>
<p>In the last lesson, we learnt how to use spring security to build a <a href="https://www.codenerve.com/spring-security-basic-login-form/">basic login form</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll be looking at adding user roles and some nice feature&#8217;s of the Thymeleaf library to show and hide content based on these roles.[/vc_column_text][us_separator][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row height=&#8221;auto&#8221;][vc_column][us_cta title=&#8221;Sample Code&#8221; color=&#8221;secondary&#8221; btn_label=&#8221;Code&#8221; btn_link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMWhyte%2Fspring-security%2Ftree%2F2.thymeleaf-extras||target:%20_blank|&#8221; btn_style=&#8221;2&#8243; btn_size=&#8221;15px&#8221; btn_icon=&#8221;fab|github&#8221;]The code for this lesson is available on GitHub[/us_cta][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row css=&#8221;%7B%22default%22%3A%7B%22margin-top%22%3A%220px%22%2C%22border-top-width%22%3A%220px%22%2C%22padding-top%22%3A%220px%22%7D%7D&#8221;][vc_column][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]Some files are already set up for you from the previous lesson: <a href="https://www.codenerve.com/spring-security-basic-login-form/">Spring Security &#8211; basic login form</a>.

</p><h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>As with all Spring boot application&#8217;s, there are a number of &#8216;Starter&#8217; libraries that make it easy to add jars to your classpath. In addition, these can auto-configure various spring beans and behaviours that we can make use of. Building upon the previous lesson we will be adding:</p>
<ul>
<li>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity4 &#8211; this has a number of additional features over the basic thymeleaf jar.</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
<h3>WebSecurityConfig</h3>
<p>To begin this lesson we&#8217;ll be adding another user to our application&#8217;s WebSecurityConfig but this time giving them a new role &#8216;admin&#8217;:</p>
<p>WebSecurityConfig.java</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth
                .inMemoryAuthentication()
                .withUser("user").password("{noop}pass").roles("USER")
                .and()
                .withUser("admin").password("{noop}pass").roles("ADMIN");
    }</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This now gives us two available user&#8217;s to log in with. Each is configured with a different role that we can now use to hide and show various content.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Thymeleaf: Authorize</h3>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll be using a Thymeleaf attribute sec:authorize to check a users roles before rendering div&#8217;s our index.html page.</p>
<p>To do this, go to the index.html page and add the following HTML inside the body tags:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">        &lt;div sec:authorize="hasRole('ADMIN')"&gt;
            This content is only shown to administrators.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div sec:authorize="hasRole('USER')"&gt;
            This content is only shown to users.
        &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>As you can see the sec:authorize attribute is added to each div, and we use something called the spring security dialect to check users spring security roles. Content will only be rendered if the logged-in user has that role. i.e. &#8216;hasRole&#8217; returns true.</p>
<p>It is important to note that content is not just hidden but will not be rendered at all when our application server returns the page to the browser.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Thymeleaf: Authentication</h3>
<p>Another useful Thymeleaf feature is the &#8216;sec:authentication&#8217; attribute. This can return various security-related metadata. In the example below, we can retrieve the user&#8217;s username and roles and display these in our HTML.</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">        &lt;div&gt;
            User: &lt;span sec:authentication="name"&gt;NOT FOUND&lt;/span&gt;
            Spring Roles: &lt;span sec:authentication="principal.authorities"&gt;NOT FOUND&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more useful attribute&#8217;s see the Thymeleaf documentation: <a href="https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Demo</h3>
<p>To run the demo, open the <em>Application</em> class and right click run. In order to start the example, the port 8080 will need to be available on your machine. If it is not you can change this default in the application.properties file using:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">server.port=8081</pre>
<p>Set this to whatever value you wish.[/vc_column_text][vc_video link=&#8221;https://youtu.be/khAjDT9szTM&#8221; video_title=&#8221;1&#8243;][us_separator][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Unit Testing</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve added a few unit tests to cover this new functionality:</p>
<p>ApplicationTests.java</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">	@Test
	@WithMockUser(roles = "USER")
	public void loginWithRoleUserThenExpectUserSpecificContent() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(get("/index"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andExpect(content().string(containsString("This content is only shown to users.")))
				.andExpect(content().string(doesNotContainString("This content is only shown to administrators.")));
	}

	@Test
	@WithMockUser(roles = "ADMIN")
	public void loginWithRoleAdminThenExpectAdminSpecificContent() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(get("/index"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andExpect(content().string(containsString("This content is only shown to administrators.")))
				.andExpect(content().string(doesNotContainString("This content is only shown to users.")));
	}

	private Matcher&lt;String&gt; doesNotContainString(String s) {
		return CoreMatchers.not(containsString(s));
	}</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see we&#8217;ve created a utility method <em>doesNotContainString. </em>Using this and Hamcrests <em>containsString </em>method, we can check that content is rendered (or not) based on a particular user role.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3><a href="https://www.codenerve.com/spring-security-user-role-redirect/">Next</a></h3>
<p>Next up, we will be continuing to cover spring security&#8217;s user roles, but this time we will be redirecting admins to there own admin page (admin.html) and securing this page so that only admin users can access it.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation layout=&#8221;sided&#8221;][/vc_column][/vc_row]

<li>Some Thymeleaf HTML templates are located under src/main/resources/ for demo purposes also.</li>
<li>An application.properties file is located under src/main/resources where we can pass configuration parameters to our spring boot application.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>As with all Spring boot application&#8217;s, there are a number of &#8216;Starter&#8217; libraries that make it easy to add jars to your classpath. In addition, these can auto-configure various spring beans and behaviours that we can make use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>spring-boot-starter-parent &#8211; brings in all the required spring dependencies and manages there versions</li>
<li>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf &#8211; adds thymeleaf-spring5 and thymeleaf-extras-java8time dependencies (<a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more on thymeleaf</a>)</li>
<li>spring-boot-starter-security &#8211; adds spring-security-config, spring-security-web and spring-aop dependencies</li>
<li>spring-boot-starter-test &#8211; adds spring-boot-test, junit, <a href="http://hamcrest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hamcrest</a> and <a href="https://site.mockito.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mockito</a></li>
<li>spring-security-test &#8211; adds the ability to mock user and user roles</li>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on in this class as it contains the main security configuration to enable and configure our basic login form.</p>
<h5>@EnableWebSecurity</h5>
<p>A Marker which allows spring to find custom web application security configuration</p>
<h5>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</h5>
<p>Another abstract base class that allows you to override certain aspects of spring security&#8217;s default configuration. In our case, we are going to override the methods <em>configure</em> and <em>configureGlobal</em>.</p>
<h5>configure(HttpSecurity http) method</h5>
<p>Note the parameter passed to this method. There several different <em>configure</em> methods. We will be overriding and configuring <em>HttpSecurity </em>specifically<em>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>authorizeRequests()</em> &#8211; Allows us to configure which resources on our webserver to secure. You can see from our example code we have allowed un-secured access to our CSS directory and requested that all other resources are secured and can only be accessed by an authenticated user.</li>
<li><em>formLogin()</em> &#8211; Tells spring security that we wish to use a login form. We provide the login URL, the URL we want to redirect to if the authentication is successful and finally permit access to the login and logout endpoints.</li>
<li><em>csrf()</em> &#8211; For now we are disabling cross-site request forgery protection which by default is enabled. We will cover this later in the series.</li>
</ul>
<h5>configureGlobal method</h5>
<p>Allows us to autowire an <em>AuthenticationManager</em> which will be used globally throughout our application. For this example, we are using a basic in-memory approach with one user and one user role.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Thymeleaf namespace</h3>
<p>A few things to note in our login.html</p>
<p>The thymeleaf spring security namespace:</p>
<pre class="lang:js decode:true">&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"
      xmlns:sec="http://www.thymeleaf.org/thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity3"&gt;</pre>
<p>This action instructs the form to make a POST request to the URL provided (/login)</p>
<pre class="lang:js decode:true">&lt;form th:action="@{/login}" method="post" class="form login"&gt;</pre>
<p>The if condition can check for a URL parameter, error and logout in this case and display content if they return true</p>
<pre class="lang:js decode:true">        &lt;div class="text--center" th:if="${param.error}"&gt;
            Invalid username and password.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="text--center" th:if="${param.logout}"&gt;

We can use this to create, edit and manipulate dates in our programs. This is something which no data type we have learnt so far is particularly good at. We will also briefly cover the old Date and time classes and why these were upgraded in Java 8.</p>

Please note that the Date and Time library covered in this lesson is new to java 8. Therefore you will need to be using a minimum version of the java 8 JDK or JRE. If you have an older version installed please upgrade <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

[/us_message][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]
<h4>The old date library</h4>
<p>Up to and including Java 7 there was still the ability to create Date and time functionality mainly through the <em>java.util.Date</em> and the <em>java.util.Calendar </em>classes. These classes where poorly written and became even more difficult to use from version to version. The main issues with the old Date and Time classes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor naming &#8211; a Date was actually a timestamp and a Calendar was actually a mixture of date&#8217;s and times.</li>
<li>Limited ability to support different timezones</li>
<li>Concurrency issues &#8211; we will cover this subject in the advanced course</li>
<li>Months starting with zero instead of 1, Dates must have a year etc</li>
<li>Inoperability with other &#8216;Date&#8217; type classes</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all using the standard Date classes in java up until java 8 was extremely troublesome. For this reason many developers choose to use another library called <em>Joda time</em> instead of the default classes.</p>
<p>Thankfully <em>Joda&#8217;s</em> approach has now been taken onboard and a new Date and Time library has been created in java 8.</p>
[/vc_column_text][us_message type=&#8221;info&#8221;]What is a library?<p></p>
<p>A library is a collection of prewritten classes which can be specified and used by a programmer when developing a program<br>
[/us_message][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]Ok, lets start to learn the main classes of the new Date and Time Library.</p>
<h4>Clock</h4>
<p>The easiest way to get the time &#8216;right now&#8217; is with the Clock class.</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">Clock clock = Clock.systemUTC();</pre>
<p>Notice that we don&#8217;t use the <em>new </em>keyword. This is because this class is known as <em>abstract </em>which means we cant create (or instantiate) it. Instead we use special methods which return copies of Clocks to us.</p>
<p>systemUTC() is a method which returns the date and time &#8216;right now&#8217; using the UTC timezone.</p>
<p>UTC &#8211; the time standard used commonly across the world. The world&#8217;s timing centers have agreed to keep their time scales closely synchronized &#8211; or coordinated &#8211; therefore the name Coordinated Universal Time.</p>
<p>To use the default time zone on the machine the code is being run on we can also use systemDefaultZone().</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">Clock clock2 = Clock.systemDefaultZone();</pre>
<p>It is important to realise that this has a dependency to the timezone the machine running your code is set to. Java recommends that instead you explicitly state which timezone you want to be in. This way the behaviour of your code will not change if you&#8217;re running the program in different locations of the world.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h4>LocalDateTime</h4>
<p>The LocalDateTime class is a time without a timezone. This class is simply a way to describe a date and does not represent an actual exact time anywhere. We use it to describe a date and time such as a birthday or anniversaries.</p>
<p>There are many ways to create these. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">LocalDateTime localDateTime = LocalDateTime.now();

localDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 12, 25, 12, 50);
localDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 12, 25, 12, 50, 51);
localDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 12, 25, 12, 50, 51, 19000);
localDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, Month.DECEMBER, 25, 12, 50);
localDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, Month.DECEMBER, 25, 12, 50, 51);
localDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, Month.DECEMBER, 25, 12, 50, 51, 19000);
localDateTime = LocalDateTime.of( Year.now().getValue(), Month.FEBRUARY, DayOfWeek.SATURDAY.getValue(), 1, 1, 1 );</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that again we do not use the new keyword. Instead we use special helper methods to create the LocalDateTime for us. You&#8217;ll also notice in the last few examples that we have other helper classes/methods we can use to create Years, Months and DayOfWeeks for us.</p>
<p>For a full list of the parameters we pass to the of method above practice creating LocalDateTimes in your IDE with auto complete and/or use Oracle&#8217;s official <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDateTime.html#of-int-int-int-int-int-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h4>LocalDate</h4>
<p>LocalDate is similar to LocalDateTime but with out the time or timezone. To create this we have various methods we can use on the LocalDate class:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
LocalDate ofDate = LocalDate.of(2014,1,1);
LocalDate epochDate = LocalDate.ofEpochDay(0l);</pre>
<p>Again this can be used for things like birthdays and other dates that do not require times or timezones.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h4>LocalTime</h4>
<p>Conversely, LocalTime is similar to LocalDateTime but with out the Date or timezone added. To create this we have various methods we can use on the LocalTime class:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">LocalTime timeNow = LocalTime.now();
LocalTime timeOf = LocalTime.of(12, 00);</pre>
<p>All of the above classes (LocalDateTime, LocalDate and LocalTime) cannot be used to find an exact point in time due to there lack of timezone functionality. So these are just used to represent date and times in a human readable way.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h4>Instant</h4>
<p>To represent an exact point in time we can use the Instant class:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">Instant instant = Instant.now();</pre>
<p>You can also convert Strings into Instants:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">instant = Instant.parse("2015-11-20T11:10:59Z");</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]As always play around with the examples and try to use them in your own basic program.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h4>Next: Primitive types vs wrapper classes</h4>

<h3>Reading basic input</h3>
<p>The first thing we are going to look at is reading in a string from the console view in our IDE using a Buffered reader. This will allow us to interact with the program during it&#8217;s execution.</p>
<p>First create a new class called &#8216;ReadingInput&#8217; with a main method.</p>
<p>Then, within the main method copy the following:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));</pre>
<p>You will notice some compilation errors, ignore these for a moment. Next, paste the following code underneath:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String s = br.readLine();
        System.out.println("You entered " + s);</pre>
<p>So what about all those nasty errors? For that we need to learn the concept of Imports.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Imports</h3>
<p>Up until now, everything we have learn&#8217;t has been using a collection of classes in a package called java.lang.</p>
[/vc_column_text][us_message type=&#8221;info&#8221;]Forgot what a package is?<p></p>
<p>A package is a directory to hold and organise java classes (java files). Classes can be grouped together in packages in some sort of logical order.<br>
[/us_message][vc_column_text]
</p><p>An example of something we have used from the java.lang package is printing to our console:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true"> 
System.out.println();</pre>
<p>However, the package <em>java.lang</em> is automatically imported into each java file(or class) that we create so we haven&#8217;t had to use imports yet.</p>
<p>The <em>BufferedReader</em> and the <em>InputStreamReader</em> used in the example above are in another package called <em>java.io </em>(IO = Input / Output). This package contains classes for reading and writing to and from a number of different sources such as files, network connections and you guessed it user input.</p>
<p>So for our example to work we will need to use the following import:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">import java.io.*;</pre>
<p>Imports are written between the package of the class we are in and the creation of the class itself. So the example so far looks like:</p>
<pre class="striped:true lang:java decode:true">package com.codenerve.beginner.lesson9;

import java.io.*;

public class ReadingInput {

    public static void main(String[] args)  throws IOException {

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String s = br.readLine();
        System.out.println("You entered " + s);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Once the import is declared we are able to access all the features of the IO package.</p>
<p>We will cover imports in more detail through the lesson series but for now just know that there are lots of packages which contain many classes that we can re-use depending on our needs. These are all part of the JRE.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #999999;">If you would like to start looking at other packages check out the official <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">java docs</a>.</span></em></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also notice that I have added <em>throws IOException</em> to the main method signature. This is simply saying that if the user inputs some unknown data, raise an error and close the program. Exceptions will be covered extensively in the intermediate tutorials.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h5>Ok lets continue</h5>
<p>Wether using Eclipse or IntelliJ have a look at the short video clips below on how to run the code and enter some input:[/vc_column_text][vc_tta_tabs][vc_tta_section active=&#8221;1&#8243; title=&#8221;Eclipse&#8221;][vc_video link=&#8221;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltvamMqTPrg&amp;hd=1&#8243;][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;IntelliJ&#8221;][vc_video link=&#8221;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3wo7bc-bmU&amp;hd=1&#8243;][/vc_tta_section][/vc_tta_tabs][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>So what are these new classes doing?</h3>
<h6>System.in</h6>
<p>This is the standard input stream for any incoming data. This stream by default is open and ready to read input once declared. The most common use of this stream is to capture keyboard input or user input.</p>
<h6>InputStreamReader</h6>
<p>An InputStreamReader converts byte streams to character streams.</p>
<h6>BufferedReader</h6>
<p>Lastly, the BufferedRedaer reads text from a character-input stream (in out case an InputStreamReader), buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters.</p>
<p>readLine() simply reads a line of text.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Another example of reading input</h3>
<p>Lets take another example for reading in a string and converting it to an integer. Copy the following code to your example. You can replace the code under the buffered reader or just add it below the previous example:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">        System.out.print("Enter an Integer: ");
        int i = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        System.out.println("You entered " + i);</pre>
<p>This time when running the example enter a number. You will see that the input is converted to an Integer using the parseInt method which is inside the Integer class (The Integer class is part of the java.lang package so no need for any imports).</p>
<p>Although we are not covering exceptions until the next lesson series I would also encourage you to run this example and input a string which is not a number. You will see an example of a possible &#8216;Exception&#8217;.</p>

<h3>What are Arrays?</h3>
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/04/array-bright-cloth-5872.jpg" alt="Lesson 8 - Arrays"><p>An array is a container that holds a number of values of a particular type. Imagine we had to declare a number of book titles for example. With the variables you&#8217;ve been taught in previous lessons we could write:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">        String title1 = "a";
        String title2 = "b";
        String title3 = "c";
        String title4 = "d";</pre>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a bad solution if there are only 2 or 3 books but what if there&#8217;s ten or a hundred book&#8217;s? For this we are better using an array that can hold large numbers of related data.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Creating Arrays</h3>
<p>Ok so let&#8217;s create one! First off let&#8217;s create a new class called Arrays.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]To create an array we use the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">String[] books = {"1984", "Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy", "Harry Potter", "A tale of two cities"};</pre>
<p>Here we have an array of four elements. The elements are of type String, there values are our book titles. To find out the length of an array we can use the .length variable contained inside an array object. For example:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">System.out.println("There are " + books.length + " books in the array");</pre>
<p>Will output:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">"There are 4 books in the array"</pre>
[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
<h3>Accessing elements in Arrays</h3>
<p>To access one of our titles we can use the elements numerical index. But first let me explain this a little more. To help do this I&#8217;m going to visualise the array we created above:</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="https://www.ni-geeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png"><img class="wp-image-717 size-full alignleft" src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png" alt="Lesson 8 - Arrays" width="694" height="290" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png 694w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17-300x125.png 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17-600x251.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An array consists of a number of elements. The number of elements depends on the number of values you inserted when you created the array. You should note that the first elements index is zero. So to access the first element in the array we would use:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">books[0]</pre>
<p>Try it! Create our array above and use the following to print out the second element in the array:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">System.out.println("Our second title is: " + books[1]);</pre>
[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
<h3>Iterating through Arrays</h3>
<p>So now you&#8217;re able to extract values from the array which is great. But now were going to combine our knowledge of arrays with an older lesson on <a title="Lesson 6 – Loops" href="https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/">loops</a>. Iterating through an array is a very common pattern in programming and will be a very powerful tool to have. Lets look at the following code:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">    private static void iteratingThroughAnArray() {

        String[] books = {"1984", "Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy", "Harry Potter", "A tale of two cities"};

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; books.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Book " + i + " Title: " + books[i]);
        }
    }</pre>
<p>Add this method to your Arrays class and call it from your main method. You will see in the console output it will loop through every element in the array you created and print each title out.</p>
<p>Whats interesting here is the use of the loops <em>i</em> variable. As the for loop steps through each loop, <em>i</em> is incremented. As you can see it starts at zero. Which is perfect for accessing the first element in the array. We also set the upper limit of the array to be <em>&lt; books.length. </em>This is very important! I encourage you to try to access an element in the array that doesn&#8217;t exist to see why! Try books[99] for example (Hint: You will see lots of red!).[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Reminder of the Java 5 Enhanced For loop</h3>
<p>So now were going to remind ourselves of the enhanced for loop. We briefly covered this in the <a title="Lesson 6 – Loops" href="https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/">loops lesson</a>. Lets have a look at another method which does the same thing as the previous example only using the enhanced loop:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">    private static void usingTheEnhancedForLoop() {

        String[] books = {"1984", "Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy", "Harry Potter", "A tale of two cities"};

        for (String book : books) {
            System.out.println("Title: " + book);
        }

    }</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ll see from the output this is (almost) the same method as before. An advantage however is the i variable and the books.length are not required. This is therefore less prone to errors (like the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException you would have seen if you&#8217;d tried to access an element that doesn&#8217;t exist).</p>
<p>It also has a few drawbacks. You cannot access the numerical index of the current element in the array because there is no i variable and also these loops can only go in one direction. In the previous loop you could have declared your array like:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">    private static void iteratingThroughAnArray_backwards() {

        String[] books = {"1984", "Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy", "Harry Potter", "A tale of two cities"};

        for (int i = books.length -1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
            System.out.println("Book " + i + " Title: " + books[i]);
        }
    }</pre>
<p>This array will print the titles in the reverse order. This is why its useful to learn both arrays depending on what you need to do with your array.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Arrays With Methods</h3>
<p>As with all the other types you have learnt, arrays can be passed into and returned from methods.</p>
<p>Passing in arrays:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">    private static void usingArraysInMethods(String[] anotherStringArray) {
        // arrays like other data types can be passed into methods and used

        for (String book : anotherStringArray) {
            System.out.println("Title: " + book);
        }
    }</pre>
<p>Passing in and returning arrays:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">    private static String[] returningArraysFromMethods(String[] anotherStringArray) {

        // arrays like other data types can be passed into methods and also returned

        for (String book : anotherStringArray) {
            // lets make all items in the array lower case
            book = book.toLowerCase();

            System.out.println("Title: " + book);
        }
        return anotherStringArray;
    }</pre>
<p>The example above takes in the array makes all values lower case and returns the array.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>2D Arrays</h3>
<p>Are last example in the lesson is the Two Dimensional array. So far in this lesson we have just been using strings but you can use any type. We could create arrays of type int, boolean OR another array!</p>
<p>The easiest way to think of a 2D array is an array of arrays. Lets have a look at creating one:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">    private static void AnotherTwoDimensionalArray() {
        String[][] books = {
                {"1984", "George Orwell", "£9.99"},
                {"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy", "Douglas Adams", "£9.99"}};

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; books.length; i++) {

            System.out.println("Title: " + books[i][0] + " Author: " + books[i][1] + " Price: " + books[i][2]);
        }
    }</pre>
<p>Creating the array you will see we use two groups of square brackets instead of one to declare a 2d array:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">String[][] books</pre>
<p>You will also see that when adding our values to the 2d array there are arrays inside of the main array:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">{
    {"1984", "George Orwell", "£9.99"},
    {"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy", "Douglas Adams", "£9.99"}
};</pre>
<p>Accessing values in the array is also different. We again need to use two square brackets with two numerical indexes:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">books[x][y]</pre>
<p>To explain this lets use another diagram:</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="https://www.ni-geeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-752 size-large" src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-1024x209.png" alt="Lesson 8 - Arrays" width="1024" height="209" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-1024x209.png 1024w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-300x61.png 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-768x157.png 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-600x123.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>As mentioned we can access a 2d with a two numerical indexes x and y in this case. The diagram shows the x index accessing the first element in the outside array and the y accessing an element in the array that is referred to by x.</p>
<p>Surprisingly the java spec limits the amount of dimensions you can create on an array to 255! I have yet to need anything beyond 3 and I can only imagine that to require a 255d array you would need to be a physics genius!</p>
<p>As always try to get the code running and play around with it. See if you can iterate through the 2d array above and access the elements within it.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]

<p>Most of the code you have written so far gets executed from top to bottom in the order that you have written it. Control flow statements, however, break up this flow by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to execute particular blocks of code depending on whether or not certain conditions are met.[/us_message][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][us_iconbox icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221; size=&#8221;48px&#8221; iconpos=&#8221;left&#8221; title=&#8221;Downloads&#8221; alignment=&#8221;left&#8221;]To get started you can use the basic <a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/StarterProject.zip">starter project</a> and follow the steps to compile the code examples for the lesson.[/us_iconbox][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>If Statements</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive straight in and set up a new class with a main method. The first example is a basic for loop:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static void anIfStatement() {
   int x = 1;

   if (x &gt;=0){
     System.out.println("X is a positive number");
   }
}</pre>
<p>So hopefully the syntax is familiar from the last lesson on <a href="https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/">loops</a>. In plain English this code can be read:</p>
<p>&#8220;If x is greater or equal to zero. Execute the code inside the if statement (the curly braces {})&#8221;. If it is not greater or equal to zero don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>As always copy the code, call it from your main method and run it. Change the value of x to say -2 and rerun it. Do you see the output this time?</p>
<h6>Another If statement</h6>
<p>Ok, before we continue let&#8217;s have a look at another if condition. This one is going to pass a parameter into a method and based on the result of the if condition inside, return one of the two possible results:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static String anotherIfStatement(int grade) {

    if (grade &gt;=40){
        return "Congratulations you have passed the exam!";
    }
    return "Unfortunately you have failed.";
}</pre>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>If you have forgotten about the keyword &#8216;return&#8217; or passing parameters to methods, please revisit <a title="Lesson 5 – Methods" href="https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-5-methods/"><span style="color: #999999;">lesson 5</span></a> on methods.</em></span></p>
<p>As you can see, this method takes in an <em>int</em> called grade and returns a String. Which string depends on the grade parameters value. If the grade is greater or equal to 40, then the if condition is true and it will execute the code inside the if condition. Thus returning the first string. If it is not &gt;=40, then the if the condition is false, it will skip over the code enclosed in the if condition and it will return the second string.</p>
<p>To run the code add the following to the main method and change the grade parameter to return the different strings:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">String passOrFail = anotherIfStatement(10);
System.out.println(passOrFail);</pre>
[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
<h3>If &#8230; Else Statements</h3>
<p>Ok, time for another conditional. This time, let&#8217;s look at the If .. Else condition:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">	private static String anIfElseStatement(int grade) {

		if (grade &gt;=40){
			return "Congratulations you have passed the exam!";
		} else {
			return "Unfortunately you have failed.";
		}
	}</pre>
<p>Run the code from your main method and change the grade parameter. After you do this, you may be wondering what the difference is between the if else and the if condition we looked at previously.</p>
<p>The difference is that the if statement either executes or does not depending on the condition. Whereas, the if else condition must execute one of the two possible branches. i.e. it must print one of the two strings inside the if else condition.</p>
<p>Therefore if conditions give you the option to run something or not. If else&#8217;s make a choice which code block to execute.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>If else if conditions</h3>
<p>Following on from the &#8216;if else&#8217; condition we are now going to have a look at the &#8216;if else if&#8217; condition! This construct follows on quite naturally from the last example so let&#8217;s just take a look first:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static String anotherIfElseIfStatement(int grade) {

     if (grade &gt;=70){
         return "Congratulations you have aced the exam!";
     } else if (grade &gt;=40) {
         return "Congratulations you have passed the exam!";
     } else {
         return "Unfortunately you have failed.";
     }
}</pre>
<p>So as you can see we can effectively join <em>if else</em> statements together. It&#8217;s important to know here however that only one <em>if</em> condition (or the final else) will ever be executed. In the case above thats a bit obvious since the code block inside each <em>if</em> has a return statement. Therefore once one <em>if</em> is true and the code is executed. It will return a value from the method.</p>
<p>But what about the following method?</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static String anotherIfElseIfStatement(int grade) {

   String result;

   if (grade &gt;=70){
       result = "Congratulations you have aced the exam!";
   } else if (grade &gt;=40) {
       result = "Congratulations you have passed the exam!";
   } else {
       result = "Unfortunately you have failed.";
   }
   return result;
}</pre>
<p>If I pass in a grade of 80, you could easily be confused into thinking that the first <em>if</em> would set the String <em>result</em> then the second <em>if</em> would set the String <em>result</em> again. Since both of these <em>if</em> conditions are true. But, this is not the case. Java will execute the first true <em>if</em> condition and skip over the rest. Or, if no <em>if</em> condition is true only run the <em>else</em> block[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Switch Statement</h3>
<p>Switch statements are useful when there are many finite paths the code can go down. Unlike if and if else statements switch statements do not evaluate expressions such as greater than. A switch works with the byte, short, char, and int primitive data types. As well as Strings and Enums(we will cover these later). So let us take a look at our example:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static String aSwitchStatement(int monthOfTheYear) {

        String month;

        switch (monthOfTheYear){
            case 1:
                month = "January";
                break;
            case 2:
                month = "February";
                break;
            case 3:
                month = "March";
                break;
            case 4:
                month = "April";
                break;
            case 5:
                month = "May";
                break;
            case 6:
                month = "June";
                break;
            case 7:
                month = "July";
                break;
            case 8:
                month = "August";
                break;
            case 9:
                month = "September";
                break;
            case 10:
                month = "October";
                break;
            case 11:
                month = "November";
                break;
            case 12:
                month = "December";
                break;
            default:
                month = "Unknown";
                break;
        }
        return month;
}</pre>
<p>This method converts a numerical representation of a Month and returns the name of the month as a string. So in this example, we are &#8216;switching&#8217; on an int called <em>monthOfTheYear.</em> You can see there are 12 possible cases and one default case. This means that if we enter 1, case 1 will be matched and the month string will be set to January. If you enter the value 13, no case will be matched and the default case will be used.</p>
<p>When a pattern is matched and the code inside the case is executed we call <em>break;</em> This is something that we need to look out for. If we do not call break the code will move down into the next case statement! For example:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">            case 5:
                month = "May";
                // falls through here
            case 6:
                month = "June";</pre>
<p>If we enter 5 we expect the method to return May. But in fact, case 5 will match and <i>month</i> will be set to May, then it will fall through into case 6 and set <i>month</i> to June and continue until there is a break or we have reached the end!</p>
<p>In some cases, this is perfectly acceptable, and we may want to use this behaviour. However, it is also the source of potential bugs in the real world.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]At this stage, I would encourage you to spend some time writing your own conditional statements. There was a lot of information in this lesson and practice and hands on experience are the best way to learn.</p>
<p>Think of some real world problems and try to find the most suitable construct to implement it. Here are some examples to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculating Tax using bands that are based on a persons salary</li>
<li>Charge someone for a late return</li>
<li>Calculating postage based on distance</li>
<li>Converting months to seasons</li>

<p>In the next few lessons of the series, we are going to show you that code can be executed only if certain &#8216;conditions&#8217; are met. First, we&#8217;ll look at loops and in the next lesson conditional statements.[/us_message][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][us_iconbox icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221; size=&#8221;48px&#8221; iconpos=&#8221;left&#8221; title=&#8221;Downloads&#8221; alignment=&#8221;left&#8221;]To get started you can use the basic <a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/StarterProject.zip">starter project</a> and follow the steps to compile the code examples for the lesson.[/us_iconbox][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]There are three main loops we can use in Java:</p>

Let&#8217;s get started.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>The Stupid Way</h3>
<p>Ok, Let&#8217;s have a look at something you have already learnt in previous lessons and how we can improve upon it using loops. Have a look at the following code:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static void theStupidWay() {
    System.out.println(1);
    System.out.println(2);
    System.out.println(3);
}</pre>
<p>So fairly basic right. Create a class called &#8216;Loops&#8217;, copy this into your starter project, create a main method and run the code to view its output.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s nothing particularly wrong with this, but what if we wanted to print a thousand numbers? The code would get long and unreadable to say the very least. Thankfully there&#8217;s a way to tell java to stop executing sequentially (one line after another, always downwards until the end) and instead, perform the same section of code more than once. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is the powerful concept of a loop.</span>[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>The While Loop</h3>
<p>The first loop in this lesson is the while loop. The while loop reads in plain English as:</p>
<p><strong>While </strong><b>some expression is true; execute the code inside the loop. Then recheck the expression.</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see an example:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static void basicWhileLoop() {
   int i = 1;

while (i &lt; 4){
   System.out.println(i);
   i++;
}</pre>
<p>Ok as usual try it out, copy the method into your Loops class and make sure to call it from your main method. You should notice that when you run the code, you get the same output as the previous code example.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s happening? Let&#8217;s take it step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the code is called, i is created and initialized with a value of 1.</li>
<li>The code then goes to the while expression and says: if i (i equals 1) is less than 4 return true</li>
<li>The expression is true so we go inside the loop and i is printed</li>
<li>i is then incremented by 1 (i now equals 2) and the code jumps back up to the while expression</li>
<li>This time i is still less than 4 so again i is printed and incremented by 1</li>
<li>This continues in a loop until i = 4</li>
<li>The while expression is evaluated one more time. i (4) &lt; 4 now gives a result of false, since 4 is not less than 4. The loop finishes without printing again and moves on downwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try changing the number 4 inside the while expression and run the code. Note the larger the number is, the longer the code will take to execute. This is due to the number of cycles the loop will go through until the code reaches its end.[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>Another While Loop</h3>
<p>Ok, we&#8217;re going to have a look at another while loop. This time we are going to use our knowledge of methods and their ability to take in parameters. In this case, the parameter is going to be the number of times the loop is to be executed:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static void anotherWhileLoop(int maxValue) {
    int i = 1;

    while (i &lt; maxValue){
        System.out.println(i);
        i++;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Copy the code, call it from your main method and run it. To call the code, you&#8217;ll need to call the method and pass a value for the <em>maxValue</em>:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">anotherWhileLoop(4);</pre>
<p>This parameterised version of the method is now much more useful to us as we can call the same code as before but with different results depending on how many times we loop through the code. Real-life applications could be adding charges to someones account based on how many days late they have returned a book. Or calculating compound interest over x number of months. The possibilities here are endless.</p>
<p>Ok, let&#8217;s move on.[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>The Do &#8230; While Loop</h3>
<p>Time to look at the do while loop. This loop is very similar to the while loop. Let&#8217;s look at the syntax and see if you can see what the difference is:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static void aDoLoop() {
    int i = 5;

    do {
        System.out.println(i);
        i++;
    } while (i &lt; 4);
}</pre>
<p>So there is a clear difference regarding the syntax of the Do loop. But the actual difference between these loops is a bit more subtle. Notice the While condition is at the end of the code block. This means the code is executed once before we evaluate whether i &lt; 4. If i equalled 5, for example, the code would print 5 before deciding not to loop. Try it for yourself![/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>The For Loop</h3>
<p>Ok, next up its the for loop. Let&#8217;s check it out:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static void theForLoop() {

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Copy the code, run it, etc. The first thing most people will think is whats the difference!? We used a while loop to do the same thing just a few minutes ago. And your right to believe that, there are ways to implement either loop and obtain the same results.</p>
<p>In general, however, we use this rule of thumb to decide which loop to use: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For loops are used when you know how many times you need to loop. While loops are used to loop until an event occurs</span>. So use a for loop if you always want to loop 100 times. And, a while loop if you want to loop until some condition or event occurs (i.e. i is no longer less than some number).[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
</p><h3>The enhanced For Loop</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a very brief look at the enhanced loop. We&#8217;re not going to go into much detail into this loop as it covers &#8216;Collections&#8217; which is something we will learn about in our intermediate course. But let&#8217;s just be aware of this loop and its syntax:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">private static void theEnhancedForLoop() {

    List&lt;Integer&gt; array = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    array.add(1);
    array.add(2);
    array.add(3);
    array.add(4);
    array.add(5);

    for (int x : array){
         System.out.println(x);
    }
}</pre>
<p>So in this method, we have created a Collection called an ArrayList. In this case, it is a list of Integers, but it can hold any type. The last few lines of the method is our enhanced for loop. This loop is capable of looping (or iterating) through each item (x) in our collection (array). We will use this more in the collections lessons.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]
