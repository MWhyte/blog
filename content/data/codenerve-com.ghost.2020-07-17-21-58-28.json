Well, the answer depends on what you are hoping to get out of it. Sure its a &#8216;nice to have&#8217; on your CV. But that alone was not really a big driver for me. Having 6 odd years experience in java I didn&#8217;t really need it on my CV so for me, it was all about going back to basics and testing myself to see just how well I knew my trade.</p>\\n<p>The answer to that was not as well as I thought I did!</p>\\n<p>Having a plethora of tools and IDE&#8217;s that provide constant feedback and auto-completion I realised that I was leaning quite heavily on these to do most of the &#8216;work&#8217; for me. Only when I sat down and started to study for the exam did I realise that I was rusty. For me refreshing my memory was the biggest gain. I feel that I now have a better understanding of the language than I ever did.</p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">You will really improve your java programming skills and foundational knowledge.</span></p>\\n<h6>Preparation Time</h6>\\n<p>For me, it was one solid week of studying and taking practice tests. I would say it would be closer to 4-6 weeks for someone relatively new. I would suggest taking some diagnostic tests if you are experienced. That way you will better understand your weaknesses and you can plan to target these areas during your studying.</p>\\n<h6>When to book your test?</h6>\\n<p>I would recommend booking your test once you can consistently pass practice exams and feel confident that you have covered all sections thoroughly.

Test\ncentres are booked through PearsonVue [http://www.pearsonvue.com/] and generally\nspeaking, there are tests available in a short\ntimeframe.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|university”][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner\nwidth=”1/4″][us_image image=”879″ size=”full” onclick=”custom_link”\nlink=”url:http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0071772006%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bcamp%3D1634%26amp%3Bcreative%3D6738%26amp%3BcreativeASIN%3D0071772006%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Das2%26amp%3Btag%3Dcodenervecom-21″][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner\nwidth=”3/4″][vc_column_text]\n\nRecommended Book\nIn preparation for the OCJA exam, I used Kathy Sierra andBert Bates’ study\nguide: OCA/OCP Java SE 7 Programmer I & II Study Guide\n[http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0071772006/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0071772006&linkCode=as2&tag=codenervecom-21]\n. This is a late 2014 edition and covers all the concepts on the OCJA and OCJP\nexams. This was an excellent book with lots of examples and sample questions.\nThe authors have been writing Oracle exam study guides for many years now and\nthese books are tried and tested.\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|university”][vc_column_text]\n\nMy Study technique\nFor me, I had a fairly standard studying technique.\n\nFirst I took a diagnostic test to understand my weakest parts of the syllabus.\n\nAfter this, I would read through all sections of the official study guide\n[http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0071772006/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0071772006&linkCode=as2&tag=codenervecom-21]\n. Take one section in turn, read it, take notes and write LOTS of example\nprograms. Once the section is complete, take the section test and study all the\nincorrect answers in depth.\n\nThis repeated until the end of the book. After this, I took my second diagnostic\ntest.\n\nFrom then on, I continued to learn all incorrect answers from tests taken and\nfocus on weak topics. In the last few days, I repeated this frantically until I\nwas happy and finally got to the stage where I was consistently passing the\nexams.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|university”][vc_column_text]\n\nTest Providers\nWhizlabs\nWhizlabs describes itself as a learning hub which contains dozens of various\ncourses and practice exams. The practice papers and reporting were very good.\nHowever, it frustrated me that each question renders a new webpage. This made it\na bit slow and relies on a internet connection.\n\nOverall though there was a good number of questions and good reporting.\n\nPrice: £39.95[/vc_column_text][us_image_slider\nids=”1019,1020,1021,1022,1024,1023,1031,1032″ type=”1″][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|university”][vc_column_text]\n\nEnthuware\nEnthuware [http://enthuware.com/]has an advantage in that it is downloaded and\ninstalled locally. This includes a question bank and some basic reporting. The\nui is ugly however not requiring a network connection and having no wait time\nbetween questions made this tool a lot more user friendly.\n\nThe questions on average are also much more difficult than Whizlabs and also\nthe real exam so I felt this really prepared me well.\n\nPrice: $9.95[/vc_column_text][us_image_slider ids=”1035,1036,1037,1038,1039″\ntype=”1″][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|university”][vc_column_text]\n\nWriting Sample code\nYes, I’m repeating myself but this bit is important!\n\nWhilst studying I wrote a lot of code! I would highly recommend you do the same.\nReading the book and answering the quizzes at the end of each chapter will only\nget you so far. Don’t get me wrong its a great start but if you truly want to\nunderstand the concepts in great detail then I think taking the time during each\nsection to write out the examples and experiment with them is an absolute must.\nDon’t ignore this aspect of your learning.\n\nPerhaps reluctantly I have put my examples up on Github which you can check out\nhere [https://github.com/MWhyte/OCJA]. Have a look to get an idea of how I went\nabout things but DO NOT use this as an excuse to not write out your own code\nsnippets. The process of experimenting is much more important than the end\nproduct.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|university”][vc_column_text]\n\nThe Exam\nThe exam itself can be booked on oracles\n[http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-803&p_org_id=&lang=] \nwebsite (this will redirect you to the Pearson Vue site). It consists of 70\nquestions which you have 2 hours to complete.\n\nThe pass mark is fairly high at 63% so I’d make sure you are achieving this if\nyou are using the Enthuware exams or higher if you are using Whizlabs, the book\nor any other practice exams.\n\nYou are required to book in advance but there is very little waiting time. On\nthe day you must bring I.D with you. You are also not allowed to bring any\nbooks, bags etc into the exam so check with your test centre if you need to\nbring anything to the centre.\n\nTest centres are located globally in every major city.\n\nOther resources\n * Coderanch [http://www.coderanch.com/forums/f-24/java-programmer-SCJP] –\n   Excellent forum to answer questions or ask for help\n * Oracles Education Website\n   [http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-803&p_org_id=&lang=]\n   – for more info on the test\n * Pearson Vue [http://www.pearsonvue.com] – for booking your test\n\nFor me, this was an excellent experience and well worth the effort. Be aware\nthat it will take time and effort to complete. But your knowledge of the Java\nlanguage will be rock solid once you have achieved the certification.\n\nSo, get studying and good luck with your\nexam![/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation\nlayout=”sided”][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-26-at-22.54.18.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2016-02-26 22:13:43","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2020-06-09 20:44:30","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2016-02-26 22:13:43","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aecb","uuid":"e0ca084a-7986-49d3-8cba-b9f08e6a4ba2","title":"Spring Security","slug":"spring-security","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\\n<h1 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Spring Security</h1>\\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator][us_grid taxonomy_category=&#8221;spring-security&#8221; items_quantity=&#8221;&#8221; pagination=&#8221;infinite&#8221; items_layout=&#8221;blog_cards&#8221; columns=&#8221;3&#8243; img_size=&#8221;us_600_600_crop&#8221;][/vc_column][/vc_row]\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html-->[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Spring Security</h1>\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator][us_grid taxonomy_category=&#8221;spring-security&#8221; items_quantity=&#8221;&#8221; pagination=&#8221;infinite&#8221; items_layout=&#8221;blog_cards&#8221; columns=&#8221;3&#8243; img_size=&#8221;us_600_600_crop&#8221;][/vc_column][/vc_row]\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->","comment_id":"1493","plaintext":"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Spring Security\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator][us_grid taxonomy_category=”spring-security”\nitems_quantity=”” pagination=”infinite” items_layout=”blog_cards” columns=”3″\nimg_size=”us_600_600_crop”][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"page","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2018-01-17 23:00:17","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2020-06-09 20:49:22","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2018-01-17 23:00:17","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aecc","uuid":"19d2d172-d413-4462-90a9-9e118d618d0a","title":"Setting Up","slug":"setting-up","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\\n<p>This page is aimed at beginners of the Java programming language and using an Integrated Development Environment for the first time.

This will open an import\nwindow:\n\n [/content/images/wordpress/2013/12/project_1.png]\n\nSelect Next. You can now import the zip using ‘Select Archive File’ or if you\nhave already unzipped use ‘Select Root Directory’:\n\n [/content/images/wordpress/2013/12/project_2.png]\n\nClick Finish. You should now see the project load and open in the ‘Project\nExplorer’ on the left-hand side (If you do not see this view you can open it\nusing Window -> Show View -> Other -> Project Explorer). You should explore the\ncontents of the project and open the Main.java file by double clicking on it.\n\n [/content/images/wordpress/2013/12/project_3.png]\n\nLastly, you can run the program by right clicking on Main.java and select\n\nRun As -> Java Application. This will print “Hello World” in the ‘console’\nview.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][/vc_tta_tabs][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nNext: Hello World\n[https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-1-hello-world/]\nIn the first lesson of the beginner series, we’ll learn about the project\nstructure and the Main.java class\nfile.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation\nlayout=”sided”][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/begin-beginning-board-2923.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2018-01-20 12:21:00","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2020-06-09 20:02:22","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2018-01-20 12:21:00","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aecd","uuid":"c5a21b0f-e578-4dcf-bd7c-859f28504e9f","title":"Lesson 1 - Hello World","slug":"lesson-1-hello-world","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]Now that we&#8217;re finally set up; It&#8217;s time to have a look at some code.

There are also some settings files and folders which will be used by eclipse to build your project (These are nice to know about but not overly important right now).</p>\\n<h4>2. Source Folders</h4>\\n<p>Source folders are top-level folders in the project hierarchy. Source folders allow you to structure the project in some logical manner.

Packages</h4>\\n<p>A Java package is a mechanism for organising Java classes even further. The industry standard is to use your website in reverse order followed by a descriptive name for that group of files. For example, com.codenerve.main would describe a package that would contain the Main java file (or class file) that would start my application. You can use these to separate code that is for a particular purpose (for example web ui vs. backend services like database connections)</p>\\n<h4>4.

At this point we are going to create some fields of different Primitive Types.</p>\\n<p>Fields are created outside of a method but in side the class declaration:</p>\\n<p><a title=\\\"ClassFields\\\" ref=\\\"magnificPopup\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-19.04.38.png\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-158 size-full\\\" style=\\\"border: 2px solid black;\\\" title=\\\"ClassFields\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-19.04.38.png\\\" alt=\\\"ClassFields\\\" width=\\\"868\\\" height=\\\"652\\\" srcset=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-19.04.38.png 868w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-19.04.38-300x225.png 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-19.04.38-768x577.png 768w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-19.04.38-600x451.png 600w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\\\" /></a></p>\\n<p>By default <em>Fields</em> are available to all methods inside this class as well as other classes in the same package. They may also be available outside the package using the keyword <em>Public</em>. But for now we are going to just use the default.</p>\\n<h3>int</h3>\\n<p>Lets begin by creating a new field of type <em>int</em> called &#8216;integer&#8217;. Insert the following code into the class:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">static int integer;</pre>\\n<p>To access this field from within the main method we also add the <em>static</em> keyword because the main method is <em>static</em> also. We&#8217;ll learn more on this in later lessons.</p>\\n<p>An <em>int</em> represents a whole number and is 32-bits long. That means it has a minimum value of -2<sup>31</sup> and a maximum value of 2<sup>31</sup>-1.</p>\\n<p>Later in this lesson you will see other number types that are smaller or larger in size and therefore have a smaller or larger range of possible values.</p>\\n<h3>boolean</h3>\\n<p>Let&#8217;s continue to create some more fields each time underneath the last. This time a <em>boolean</em> called &#8216;bool&#8217;:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">static boolean bool;</pre>\\n<p>A <em>boolean</em> has only two possible values <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.</p>\\n<h3>char</h3>\\n<p>A character:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">static char character;</pre>\\n<p>The <em><code>char</code></em> data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. This means it has 65,535 possible values including &#8216;a&#8217; to &#8216;z&#8217;, punctuation and numerical values are all valid here.</p>\\n<h3>byte</h3>\\n<p>A byte</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">static byte aByte;</pre>\\n<p>The <em><code>byte</code></em> data type is 8-bits. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). The <em><code>byte</code></em> data type can be useful for saving memory, in an application where memory saving is necessary (for example an applet or mobile application).</p>\\n<h3>short</h3>\\n<p>A short:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">static short aShort;</pre>\\n<p>The <code>short</code> data type is a 16-bit integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive). Like a <em>byte</em> this can be used instead of an <em>int</em> to save memory</p>\\n<h3>long</h3>\\n<p>A long:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">static long aLong;</pre>\\n<p>The <code>long</code> data type is a 64-bit integer. The long has a minimum value of -2<sup>63</sup> and a maximum value of 2<sup>63</sup>-1. Use this data type when you need a large range of values larger than that of an <code>int</code>.</p>\\n<h3>float</h3>\\n<p>A float:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">static float aFloat;</pre>\\n<p>The <em><code>float</code></em> data type is a 32-bit floating point. Use a <em><code>float</code></em> (instead of <em><code>double</code></em>) if you need to save memory.  This data type should not be used for precise values, such as currency.</p>\\n<h3>double</h3>\\n<p>A double:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">static double aDouble;</pre>\\n<p>The <em><code>double</code></em> data type is a 64-bit floating point number. For decimal values, this data type is the default choice. As mentioned above, this data type should not be used for precise values, such as currency. For accurate number values use <em>BigDecimal</em>.</p>\\n<h3>So what does this all mean?</h3>\\n<p>That depends on your level of expertise. At the minute you&#8217;ll probably use <em>double</em>, <em>boolean</em>, <em>string </em>(coming up shortly!) and <em>int</em> for 99.9% of your needs. And for now, that&#8217;s fine. Just be aware of the rest of the primitive types and their pro&#8217;s and cons ( Such memory savings and their ranges).</p>\\n<h2>Default Values</h2>\\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s get some code running. Adding the following code snippet will enable you to see the default values for all the fields you have created above:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n\\r\\n    System.out.println(\\\"Default integer value is: \\\" + integer);\\r\\n    System.out.println(\\\"Default boolean value is: \\\" + bool);\\r\\n    System.out.println(\\\"Default char value is: \\\" + character);\\r\\n    System.out.println(\\\"Default byte value is: \\\" + aByte);\\r\\n    System.out.println(\\\"Default short value is: \\\" + aShort);\\r\\n    System.out.println(\\\"Default long value is: \\\" + aLong);\\r\\n    System.out.println(\\\"Default float value is: \\\" + aFloat);\\r\\n    System.out.println(\\\"Default double value is: \\\" + aDouble);\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<h2>Output</h2>\\n<p>To run right click on the class.

They may also be available outside the package using the keyword <em>Public</em>. But for now we are going to just use the default.</p>\n<h3>int</h3>\n<p>Lets begin by creating a new field of type <em>int</em> called &#8216;integer&#8217;. Insert the following code into the class:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">static int integer;</pre>\n<p>To access this field from within the main method we also add the <em>static</em> keyword because the main method is <em>static</em> also. We&#8217;ll learn more on this in later lessons.</p>\n<p>An <em>int</em> represents a whole number and is 32-bits long. That means it has a minimum value of -2<sup>31</sup> and a maximum value of 2<sup>31</sup>-1.</p>\n<p>Later in this lesson you will see other number types that are smaller or larger in size and therefore have a smaller or larger range of possible values.</p>\n<h3>boolean</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s continue to create some more fields each time underneath the last. This time a <em>boolean</em> called &#8216;bool&#8217;:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">static boolean bool;</pre>\n<p>A <em>boolean</em> has only two possible values <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.</p>\n<h3>char</h3>\n<p>A character:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">static char character;</pre>\n<p>The <em><code>char</code></em> data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. This means it has 65,535 possible values including &#8216;a&#8217; to &#8216;z&#8217;, punctuation and numerical values are all valid here.</p>\n<h3>byte</h3>\n<p>A byte</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">static byte aByte;</pre>\n<p>The <em><code>byte</code></em> data type is 8-bits. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). The <em><code>byte</code></em> data type can be useful for saving memory, in an application where memory saving is necessary (for example an applet or mobile application).</p>\n<h3>short</h3>\n<p>A short:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">static short aShort;</pre>\n<p>The <code>short</code> data type is a 16-bit integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive). Like a <em>byte</em> this can be used instead of an <em>int</em> to save memory</p>\n<h3>long</h3>\n<p>A long:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">static long aLong;</pre>\n<p>The <code>long</code> data type is a 64-bit integer. The long has a minimum value of -2<sup>63</sup> and a maximum value of 2<sup>63</sup>-1. Use this data type when you need a large range of values larger than that of an <code>int</code>.</p>\n<h3>float</h3>\n<p>A float:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">static float aFloat;</pre>\n<p>The <em><code>float</code></em> data type is a 32-bit floating point. Use a <em><code>float</code></em> (instead of <em><code>double</code></em>) if you need to save memory.  This data type should not be used for precise values, such as currency.</p>\n<h3>double</h3>\n<p>A double:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">static double aDouble;</pre>\n<p>The <em><code>double</code></em> data type is a 64-bit floating point number. For decimal values, this data type is the default choice. As mentioned above, this data type should not be used for precise values, such as currency. For accurate number values use <em>BigDecimal</em>.</p>\n<h3>So what does this all mean?</h3>\n<p>That depends on your level of expertise. At the minute you&#8217;ll probably use <em>double</em>, <em>boolean</em>, <em>string </em>(coming up shortly!) and <em>int</em> for 99.9% of your needs. And for now, that&#8217;s fine. Just be aware of the rest of the primitive types and their pro&#8217;s and cons ( Such memory savings and their ranges).</p>\n<h2>Default Values</h2>\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s get some code running. Adding the following code snippet will enable you to see the default values for all the fields you have created above:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(\"Default integer value is: \" + integer);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Default boolean value is: \" + bool);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Default char value is: \" + character);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Default byte value is: \" + aByte);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Default short value is: \" + aShort);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Default long value is: \" + aLong);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Default float value is: \" + aFloat);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Default double value is: \" + aDouble);\r\n}</pre>\n<h2>Output</h2>\n<p>To run right click on the class.

In the new Methods class create the following method:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void aSimpleMethod() {\\r\\n     System.out.println(\\\"Hello Methods\\\");\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, create a main method inside your class also:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>Now if you run your code at this point (try it!) you&#8217;re going to find the output a bit disappointing!! So far our example program does nothing 🙁</p>\\n<p>Why? We&#8217;ll because your <em>main</em> method is not yet using the <em>aSimpleMethod()</em> method you created. To fix this you need to <strong>call</strong> your new method:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n    aSimpleMethod();\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>Run it again and you should see the contents of your new method executed in the console view.</p>\\n<p><strong>private static void<br />\\n</strong>We&#8217;ve discussed these keywords briefly in previous lessons but let&#8217;s recap on their meaning:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>private &#8211; means the method is only available from this class (Methods.java) and no other. It cannot be &#8216;called&#8217; from another class. We&#8217;ll discuss other options later in the lesson series.</li>\\n<li>static &#8211; let&#8217;s leave this for now. For now, all of your methods will be static</li>\\n<li>void &#8211; this is the return type of the method. <em>Void</em> means that the method does not <strong>return</strong> any value. We&#8217;ll show a method later in this lesson that passes values back to your main method.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Method with Parameters</h3>\\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s create another method. This time we are going to <strong>pass</strong> some parameters to your method. Add the following code to your class file:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void aMethodWithParameters(int i, int j) {\\r\\n     System.out.println(i + j);\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>Again like the previous example, we must call this from our main method:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n     aSimpleMethod();\\r\\n     aMethodWithParameters(4,5);\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>Run the program again. This time you will see the second method is <strong>called</strong> by your main method and printing the sum of the two numbers you passed in. It&#8217;s important to note that you can also reuse these methods as many times as you like:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n     aSimpleMethod();\\r\\n     aMethodWithParameters(4 , 5);\\r\\n     aMethodWithParameters(1 , 5);\\r\\n     aMethodWithParameters(100 , 5);\\r\\n     aMethodWithParameters(4 , 500);\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<h3>Methods that return values</h3>\\n<p>Alright, let&#8217;s try something else now. What if we don&#8217;t just want to print a result but instead we want to get that value back and do something else with it. To do this we can <strong>return</strong> the result of a method. Add the following class to our code:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static int aMethodWithAReturnValue(int i, int j, int k) {\\r\\n      return i + j + k;\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice something different about this method. No, I&#8217;m not talking about the extra parameter <em>int k.</em> That was added just to show you that methods can take as many parameters as you require. I&#8217;m referring to the <em>int</em> return type. Previously we used void meaning return nothing. This time we want to return an int. To do this you will also notice the <strong>return</strong> keyword used inside the method.</p>\\n<p>Alternatively, we could write:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static int aMethodWithAReturnValue(int i, int j, int k) {\\r\\n      int result = i + j + k;\\r\\n      return result;\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>This is just a more verbose way of writing the same thing as the previous example.</p>\\n<p>Ok, again like before, we need to call this from our main method but this time we need to capture the result. And lastly, we will print the result out so you can see the result in the console view:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">int result = aMethodWithAReturnValue(4,5,6);\\r\\nSystem.out.println(result);</pre>\\n<h3>Try writing your own Methods</h3>\\n<p>As with all my lessons, try writing your own methods. Try using different primitive types or Strings instead of <em>ints</em>. Also, see if you can chain some methods together. For example:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">aMethodWithParameters(aMethodWithAReturnValue(4,5,6),aMethodWithAReturnValue(4,5,6));</pre>\\n<p>What would be the result of the above code??

Have a look at the following code:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void theStupidWay() {\\r\\n    System.out.println(1);\\r\\n    System.out.println(2);\\r\\n    System.out.println(3);\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>So fairly basic right. Create a class called &#8216;Loops&#8217;, copy this into your starter project, create a main method and run the code to view its output.</p>\\n<p>So there&#8217;s nothing particularly wrong with this, but what if we wanted to print a thousand numbers? The code would get long and unreadable to say the very least. Thankfully there&#8217;s a way to tell java to stop executing sequentially (one line after another, always downwards until the end) and instead, perform the same section of code more than once. <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">This is the powerful concept of a loop.</span>[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>The While Loop</h3>\\n<p>The first loop in this lesson is the while loop. The while loop reads in plain English as:</p>\\n<p><strong>While </strong><b>some expression is true; execute the code inside the loop. Then recheck the expression.</b></p>\\n<p>Let&#8217;s see an example:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void basicWhileLoop() {\\r\\n   int i = 1;\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile (i &lt; 4){\\r\\n   System.out.println(i);\\r\\n   i++;\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>Ok as usual try it out, copy the method into your Loops class and make sure to call it from your main method. You should notice that when you run the code, you get the same output as the previous code example.</p>\\n<p>So what&#8217;s happening? Let&#8217;s take it step by step:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>When the code is called, i is created and initialized with a value of 1.</li>\\n<li>The code then goes to the while expression and says: if i (i equals 1) is less than 4 return true</li>\\n<li>The expression is true so we go inside the loop and i is printed</li>\\n<li>i is then incremented by 1 (i now equals 2) and the code jumps back up to the while expression</li>\\n<li>This time i is still less than 4 so again i is printed and incremented by 1</li>\\n<li>This continues in a loop until i = 4</li>\\n<li>The while expression is evaluated one more time. i (4) &lt; 4 now gives a result of false, since 4 is not less than 4. The loop finishes without printing again and moves on downwards.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Try changing the number 4 inside the while expression and run the code. Note the larger the number is, the longer the code will take to execute. This is due to the number of cycles the loop will go through until the code reaches its end.[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>Another While Loop</h3>\\n<p>Ok, we&#8217;re going to have a look at another while loop. This time we are going to use our knowledge of methods and their ability to take in parameters. In this case, the parameter is going to be the number of times the loop is to be executed:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void anotherWhileLoop(int maxValue) {\\r\\n    int i = 1;\\r\\n\\r\\n    while (i &lt; maxValue){\\r\\n        System.out.println(i);\\r\\n        i++;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>Copy the code, call it from your main method and run it. To call the code, you&#8217;ll need to call the method and pass a value for the <em>maxValue</em>:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">anotherWhileLoop(4);</pre>\\n<p>This parameterised version of the method is now much more useful to us as we can call the same code as before but with different results depending on how many times we loop through the code. Real-life applications could be adding charges to someones account based on how many days late they have returned a book. Or calculating compound interest over x number of months. The possibilities here are endless.</p>\\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s move on.[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>The Do &#8230; While Loop</h3>\\n<p>Time to look at the do while loop. This loop is very similar to the while loop. Let&#8217;s look at the syntax and see if you can see what the difference is:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void aDoLoop() {\\r\\n    int i = 5;\\r\\n\\r\\n    do {\\r\\n        System.out.println(i);\\r\\n        i++;\\r\\n    } while (i &lt; 4);\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>So there is a clear difference regarding the syntax of the Do loop. But the actual difference between these loops is a bit more subtle. Notice the While condition is at the end of the code block. This means the code is executed once before we evaluate whether i &lt; 4. If i equalled 5, for example, the code would print 5 before deciding not to loop. Try it for yourself![/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>The For Loop</h3>\\n<p>Ok, next up its the for loop. Let&#8217;s check it out:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void theForLoop() {\\r\\n\\r\\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\\r\\n        System.out.println(i);\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>Copy the code, run it, etc. The first thing most people will think is whats the difference!? We used a while loop to do the same thing just a few minutes ago. And your right to believe that, there are ways to implement either loop and obtain the same results.</p>\\n<p>In general, however, we use this rule of thumb to decide which loop to use: <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">For loops are used when you know how many times you need to loop. While loops are used to loop until an event occurs</span>. So use a for loop if you always want to loop 100 times. And, a while loop if you want to loop until some condition or event occurs (i.e. i is no longer less than some number).[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>The enhanced For Loop</h3>\\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a very brief look at the enhanced loop. We&#8217;re not going to go into much detail into this loop as it covers &#8216;Collections&#8217; which is something we will learn about in our intermediate course. But let&#8217;s just be aware of this loop and its syntax:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void theEnhancedForLoop() {\\r\\n\\r\\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; array = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\\r\\n    array.add(1);\\r\\n    array.add(2);\\r\\n    array.add(3);\\r\\n    array.add(4);\\r\\n    array.add(5);\\r\\n\\r\\n    for (int x : array){\\r\\n         System.out.println(x);\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>So in this method, we have created a Collection called an ArrayList. In this case, it is a list of Integers, but it can hold any type. The last few lines of the method is our enhanced for loop. This loop is capable of looping (or iterating) through each item (x) in our collection (array). We will use this more in the collections lessons.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-7-conditional-statements/\\\">Next: Conditional Expressions</a></h3>\\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation layout=&#8221;sided&#8221;][/vc_column][/vc_row]\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html-->[vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]Ok, In the last lesson we learnt how to use Methods, pass parameters to them and get return values.

Real-life applications could be adding charges\nto someones account based on how many days late they have returned a book. Or\ncalculating compound interest over x number of months. The possibilities here\nare endless.\n\nOk, let’s move on.[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=”small” show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nThe Do … While Loop\nTime to look at the do while loop. This loop is very similar to the while loop.\nLet’s look at the syntax and see if you can see what the difference is:\n\nprivate static void aDoLoop() {\r\n    int i = 5;\r\n\r\n    do {\r\n        System.out.println(i);\r\n        i++;\r\n    } while (i < 4);\r\n}\n\nSo there is a clear difference regarding the syntax of the Do loop. But the\nactual difference between these loops is a bit more subtle. Notice the While\ncondition is at the end of the code block. This means the code is executed once\nbefore we evaluate whether i < 4. If i equalled 5, for example, the code would\nprint 5 before deciding not to loop. Try it for\nyourself![/vc_column_text][us_separator size=”small” show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nThe For Loop\nOk, next up its the for loop. Let’s check it out:\n\nprivate static void theForLoop() {\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\r\n        System.out.println(i);\r\n    }\r\n}\n\nCopy the code, run it, etc. The first thing most people will think is whats the\ndifference!? We used a while loop to do the same thing just a few minutes ago.\nAnd your right to believe that, there are ways to implement either loop and\nobtain the same results.\n\nIn general, however, we use this rule of thumb to decide which loop to use:For\nloops are used when you know how many times you need to loop. While loops are\nused to loop until an event occurs. So use a for loop if you always want to loop\n100 times. And, a while loop if you want to loop until some condition or event\noccurs (i.e. i is no longer less than some\nnumber).[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=”small” show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nThe enhanced For Loop\nLet’s take a very brief look at the enhanced loop. We’re not going to go into\nmuch detail into this loop as it covers ‘Collections’ which is something we will\nlearn about in our intermediate course. But let’s just be aware of this loop and\nits syntax:\n\nprivate static void theEnhancedForLoop() {\r\n\r\n    List<Integer> array = new ArrayList<Integer>();\r\n    array.add(1);\r\n    array.add(2);\r\n    array.add(3);\r\n    array.add(4);\r\n    array.add(5);\r\n\r\n    for (int x : array){\r\n         System.out.println(x);\r\n    }\r\n}\n\nSo in this method, we have created a Collection called an ArrayList. In this\ncase, it is a list of Integers, but it can hold any type. The last few lines of\nthe method is our enhanced for loop. This loop is capable of looping (or\niterating) through each item (x) in our collection (array). We will use this\nmore in the collections\nlessons.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nNext: Conditional Expressions\n[https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-7-conditional-statements/]\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation\nlayout=”sided”][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/architecture-engineering-entertainment-106155.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2018-03-05 18:32:08","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2020-06-09 20:30:55","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2018-03-05 18:32:08","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aed3","uuid":"3732ddda-afe6-402c-b992-7b200fa2db04","title":"Privacy Policy","slug":"privacy-policy","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<h2>Who we are</h2>\\n<p>Our website address is: https://www.codenerve.com.</p>\\n<h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>\\n<h3>Comments</h3>\\n<p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>\\n<p>An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.

The first example is a basic for loop:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static void anIfStatement() {\\r\\n   int x = 1;\\r\\n\\r\\n   if (x &gt;=0){\\r\\n     System.out.println(\\\"X is a positive number\\\");\\r\\n   }\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>So hopefully the syntax is familiar from the last lesson on <a href=\\\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/\\\">loops</a>. In plain English this code can be read:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;If x is greater or equal to zero. Execute the code inside the if statement (the curly braces {})&#8221;. If it is not greater or equal to zero don&#8217;t.</p>\\n<p>As always copy the code, call it from your main method and run it. Change the value of x to say -2 and rerun it. Do you see the output this time?</p>\\n<h6>Another If statement</h6>\\n<p>Ok, before we continue let&#8217;s have a look at another if condition. This one is going to pass a parameter into a method and based on the result of the if condition inside, return one of the two possible results:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static String anotherIfStatement(int grade) {\\r\\n\\r\\n    if (grade &gt;=40){\\r\\n        return \\\"Congratulations you have passed the exam!\\\";\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    return \\\"Unfortunately you have failed.\\\";\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p><span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><em>If you have forgotten about the keyword &#8216;return&#8217; or passing parameters to methods, please revisit <a title=\\\"Lesson 5 – Methods\\\" href=\\\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-5-methods/\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\">lesson 5</span></a> on methods.</em></span></p>\\n<p>As you can see, this method takes in an <em>int</em> called grade and returns a String. Which string depends on the grade parameters value. If the grade is greater or equal to 40, then the if condition is true and it will execute the code inside the if condition. Thus returning the first string. If it is not &gt;=40, then the if the condition is false, it will skip over the code enclosed in the if condition and it will return the second string.</p>\\n<p>To run the code add the following to the main method and change the grade parameter to return the different strings:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">String passOrFail = anotherIfStatement(10);\\r\\nSystem.out.println(passOrFail);</pre>\\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>If &#8230; Else Statements</h3>\\n<p>Ok, time for another conditional. This time, let&#8217;s look at the If .. Else condition:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">\\tprivate static String anIfElseStatement(int grade) {\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tif (grade &gt;=40){\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treturn \\\"Congratulations you have passed the exam!\\\";\\r\\n\\t\\t} else {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treturn \\\"Unfortunately you have failed.\\\";\\r\\n\\t\\t}\\r\\n\\t}</pre>\\n<p>Run the code from your main method and change the grade parameter. After you do this, you may be wondering what the difference is between the if else and the if condition we looked at previously.</p>\\n<p>The difference is that the if statement either executes or does not depending on the condition. Whereas, the if else condition must execute one of the two possible branches. i.e. it must print one of the two strings inside the if else condition.</p>\\n<p>Therefore if conditions give you the option to run something or not. If else&#8217;s make a choice which code block to execute.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>If else if conditions</h3>\\n<p>Following on from the &#8216;if else&#8217; condition we are now going to have a look at the &#8216;if else if&#8217; condition! This construct follows on quite naturally from the last example so let&#8217;s just take a look first:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static String anotherIfElseIfStatement(int grade) {\\r\\n\\r\\n     if (grade &gt;=70){\\r\\n         return \\\"Congratulations you have aced the exam!\\\";\\r\\n     } else if (grade &gt;=40) {\\r\\n         return \\\"Congratulations you have passed the exam!\\\";\\r\\n     } else {\\r\\n         return \\\"Unfortunately you have failed.\\\";\\r\\n     }\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>So as you can see we can effectively join <em>if else</em> statements together. It&#8217;s important to know here however that only one <em>if</em> condition (or the final else) will ever be executed. In the case above thats a bit obvious since the code block inside each <em>if</em> has a return statement. Therefore once one <em>if</em> is true and the code is executed.

So let us take a look at our example:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">private static String aSwitchStatement(int monthOfTheYear) {\\r\\n\\r\\n        String month;\\r\\n\\r\\n        switch (monthOfTheYear){\\r\\n            case 1:\\r\\n                month = \\\"January\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 2:\\r\\n                month = \\\"February\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 3:\\r\\n                month = \\\"March\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 4:\\r\\n                month = \\\"April\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 5:\\r\\n                month = \\\"May\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 6:\\r\\n                month = \\\"June\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 7:\\r\\n                month = \\\"July\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 8:\\r\\n                month = \\\"August\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 9:\\r\\n                month = \\\"September\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 10:\\r\\n                month = \\\"October\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 11:\\r\\n                month = \\\"November\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            case 12:\\r\\n                month = \\\"December\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n            default:\\r\\n                month = \\\"Unknown\\\";\\r\\n                break;\\r\\n        }\\r\\n        return month;\\r\\n}</pre>\\n<p>This method converts a numerical representation of a Month and returns the name of the month as a string. So in this example, we are &#8216;switching&#8217; on an int called <em>monthOfTheYear.</em> You can see there are 12 possible cases and one default case. This means that if we enter 1, case 1 will be matched and the month string will be set to January. If you enter the value 13, no case will be matched and the default case will be used.</p>\\n<p>When a pattern is matched and the code inside the case is executed we call <em>break;</em> This is something that we need to look out for. If we do not call break the code will move down into the next case statement!

But in fact, case 5 will match and <i>month</i> will be set to May, then it will fall through into case 6 and set <i>month</i> to June and continue until there is a break or we have reached the end!</p>\\n<p>In some cases, this is perfectly acceptable, and we may want to use this behaviour.

The first example is a basic for loop:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">private static void anIfStatement() {\r\n   int x = 1;\r\n\r\n   if (x &gt;=0){\r\n     System.out.println(\"X is a positive number\");\r\n   }\r\n}</pre>\n<p>So hopefully the syntax is familiar from the last lesson on <a href=\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/\">loops</a>. In plain English this code can be read:</p>\n<p>&#8220;If x is greater or equal to zero. Execute the code inside the if statement (the curly braces {})&#8221;. If it is not greater or equal to zero don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>As always copy the code, call it from your main method and run it. Change the value of x to say -2 and rerun it. Do you see the output this time?</p>\n<h6>Another If statement</h6>\n<p>Ok, before we continue let&#8217;s have a look at another if condition. This one is going to pass a parameter into a method and based on the result of the if condition inside, return one of the two possible results:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">private static String anotherIfStatement(int grade) {\r\n\r\n    if (grade &gt;=40){\r\n        return \"Congratulations you have passed the exam!\";\r\n    }\r\n    return \"Unfortunately you have failed.\";\r\n}</pre>\n<p><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><em>If you have forgotten about the keyword &#8216;return&#8217; or passing parameters to methods, please revisit <a title=\"Lesson 5 – Methods\" href=\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-5-methods/\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\">lesson 5</span></a> on methods.</em></span></p>\n<p>As you can see, this method takes in an <em>int</em> called grade and returns a String. Which string depends on the grade parameters value. If the grade is greater or equal to 40, then the if condition is true and it will execute the code inside the if condition. Thus returning the first string. If it is not &gt;=40, then the if the condition is false, it will skip over the code enclosed in the if condition and it will return the second string.</p>\n<p>To run the code add the following to the main method and change the grade parameter to return the different strings:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">String passOrFail = anotherIfStatement(10);\r\nSystem.out.println(passOrFail);</pre>\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<h3>If &#8230; Else Statements</h3>\n<p>Ok, time for another conditional.

After you do this, you may be wondering what the difference is between the if else and the if condition we looked at previously.</p>\n<p>The difference is that the if statement either executes or does not depending on the condition. Whereas, the if else condition must execute one of the two possible branches. i.e. it must print one of the two strings inside the if else condition.</p>\n<p>Therefore if conditions give you the option to run something or not.

Or,\nif no if condition is true only run the else block[/vc_column_text][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nSwitch Statement\nSwitch statements are useful when there are many finite paths the code can go\ndown. Unlike if and if else statements switch statements do not evaluate\nexpressions such as greater than. A switch works with the byte, short, char, and\nint primitive data types. As well as Strings and Enums(we will cover these\nlater). So let us take a look at our example:\n\nprivate static String aSwitchStatement(int monthOfTheYear) {\r\n\r\n        String month;\r\n\r\n        switch (monthOfTheYear){\r\n            case 1:\r\n                month = \"January\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 2:\r\n                month = \"February\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 3:\r\n                month = \"March\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 4:\r\n                month = \"April\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 5:\r\n                month = \"May\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 6:\r\n                month = \"June\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 7:\r\n                month = \"July\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 8:\r\n                month = \"August\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 9:\r\n                month = \"September\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 10:\r\n                month = \"October\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 11:\r\n                month = \"November\";\r\n                break;\r\n            case 12:\r\n                month = \"December\";\r\n                break;\r\n            default:\r\n                month = \"Unknown\";\r\n                break;\r\n        }\r\n        return month;\r\n}\n\nThis method converts a numerical representation of a Month and returns the name\nof the month as a string. So in this example, we are ‘switching’ on an int\ncalled monthOfTheYear.You can see there are 12 possible cases and one default\ncase. This means that if we enter 1, case 1 will be matched and the month string\nwill be set to January. If you enter the value 13, no case will be matched and\nthe default case will be used.\n\nWhen a pattern is matched and the code inside the case is executed we call \nbreak;This is something that we need to look out for. If we do not call break\nthe code will move down into the next case statement! For example:\n\n            case 5:\r\n                month = \"May\";\r\n                // falls through here\r\n            case 6:\r\n                month = \"June\";\n\nIf we enter 5 we expect the method to return May. But in fact, case 5 will match\nandmonth will be set to May, then it will fall through into case 6 and set month \nto June and continue until there is a break or we have reached the end!\n\nIn some cases, this is perfectly acceptable, and we may want to use this\nbehaviour. However, it is also the source of potential bugs in the real\nworld.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]At this stage, I would encourage you to spend\nsome time writing your own conditional statements. There was a lot of\ninformation in this lesson and practice and hands on experience are the best way\nto learn.\n\nThink of some real world problems and try to find the most suitable construct to\nimplement it. Here are some examples to get you started:\n\n * Calculating Tax using bands that are based on a persons salary\n * Charge someone for a late return\n * Calculating postage based on distance\n * Converting months to seasons\n\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]Next: Arrays\n[https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-8-arrays/]\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation\nlayout=”sided”][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2019/04/business-code-codes-207580.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2019-04-03 21:18:19","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2020-06-09 20:32:53","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2019-04-03 21:18:19","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aed6","uuid":"1eda206f-d35b-4137-9ec7-ef2a125af4a7","title":"Mortgage Driven Developement","slug":"temp-slug-20","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"[vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1/1&#8243;][vc_column_text]\\n<p class=\\\"js-clip_title\\\">Matt Wynne and skills matter&#8217;s video in Mortgage driven development.</p>\\n[/vc_column_text][vc_video link=&#8221;https://vimeo.com/39660655&#8243;][us_separator icon=&#8221;fas|video&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; line_width=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]Having worked in the industry for ~5 years now this resonated with me.

Imagine we had to declare a number of book titles for example. With the variables you&#8217;ve been taught in previous lessons we could write:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">        String title1 = \\\"a\\\";\\r\\n        String title2 = \\\"b\\\";\\r\\n        String title3 = \\\"c\\\";\\r\\n        String title4 = \\\"d\\\";</pre>\\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a bad solution if there are only 2 or 3 books but what if there&#8217;s ten or a hundred book&#8217;s? For this we are better using an array that can hold large numbers of related data.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>Creating Arrays</h3>\\n<p>Ok so let&#8217;s create one! First off let&#8217;s create a new class called Arrays.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]To create an array we use the following syntax:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">String[] books = {\\\"1984\\\", \\\"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\\\", \\\"Harry Potter\\\", \\\"A tale of two cities\\\"};</pre>\\n<p>Here we have an array of four elements. The elements are of type String, there values are our book titles. To find out the length of an array we can use the .length variable contained inside an array object. For example:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">System.out.println(\\\"There are \\\" + books.length + \\\" books in the array\\\");</pre>\\n<p>Will output:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true \\\">\\\"There are 4 books in the array\\\"</pre>\\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>Accessing elements in Arrays</h3>\\n<p>To access one of our titles we can use the elements numerical index. But first let me explain this a little more. To help do this I&#8217;m going to visualise the array we created above:</p>\\n<p><a ref=\\\"magnificPopup\\\" href=\\\"https://www.ni-geeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-717 size-full alignleft\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png\\\" alt=\\\"arrays\\\" width=\\\"694\\\" height=\\\"290\\\" srcset=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png 694w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17-300x125.png 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17-600x251.png 600w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\\\" /></a></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>An array consists of a number of elements. The number of elements depends on the number of values you inserted when you created the array. You should note that the first elements index is zero. So to access the first element in the array we would use:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true \\\">books[0]</pre>\\n<p>Try it! Create our array above and use the following to print out the second element in the array:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true \\\">System.out.println(\\\"Our second title is: \\\" + books[1]);</pre>\\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>Iterating through Arrays</h3>\\n<p>So now you&#8217;re able to extract values from the array which is great. But now were going to combine our knowledge of arrays with an older lesson on <a title=\\\"Lesson 6 – Loops\\\" href=\\\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/\\\">loops</a>. Iterating through an array is a very common pattern in programming and will be a very powerful tool to have. Lets look at the following code:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true \\\">    private static void iteratingThroughAnArray() {\\r\\n\\r\\n        String[] books = {\\\"1984\\\", \\\"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\\\", \\\"Harry Potter\\\", \\\"A tale of two cities\\\"};\\r\\n\\r\\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; books.length; i++) {\\r\\n            System.out.println(\\\"Book \\\" + i + \\\" Title: \\\" + books[i]);\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }</pre>\\n<p>Add this method to your Arrays class and call it from your main method. You will see in the console output it will loop through every element in the array you created and print each title out.</p>\\n<p>Whats interesting here is the use of the loops <em>i</em> variable. As the for loop steps through each loop, <em>i</em> is incremented. As you can see it starts at zero. Which is perfect for accessing the first element in the array. We also set the upper limit of the array to be <em>&lt; books.length. </em>This is very important! I encourage you to try to access an element in the array that doesn&#8217;t exist to see why! Try books[99] for example (Hint: You will see lots of red!).[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>Reminder of the Java 5 Enhanced For loop</h3>\\n<p>So now were going to remind ourselves of the enhanced for loop. We briefly covered this in the <a title=\\\"Lesson 6 – Loops\\\" href=\\\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/\\\">loops lesson</a>. Lets have a look at another method which does the same thing as the previous example only using the enhanced loop:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true \\\">    private static void usingTheEnhancedForLoop() {\\r\\n\\r\\n        String[] books = {\\\"1984\\\", \\\"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\\\", \\\"Harry Potter\\\", \\\"A tale of two cities\\\"};\\r\\n\\r\\n        for (String book : books) {\\r\\n            System.out.println(\\\"Title: \\\" + book);\\r\\n        }\\r\\n\\r\\n    }</pre>\\n<p>You&#8217;ll see from the output this is (almost) the same method as before. An advantage however is the i variable and the books.length are not required. This is therefore less prone to errors (like the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException you would have seen if you&#8217;d tried to access an element that doesn&#8217;t exist).</p>\\n<p>It also has a few drawbacks. You cannot access the numerical index of the current element in the array because there is no i variable and also these loops can only go in one direction. In the previous loop you could have declared your array like:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">    private static void iteratingThroughAnArray_backwards() {\\r\\n\\r\\n        String[] books = {\\\"1984\\\", \\\"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\\\", \\\"Harry Potter\\\", \\\"A tale of two cities\\\"};\\r\\n\\r\\n        for (int i = books.length -1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\\r\\n            System.out.println(\\\"Book \\\" + i + \\\" Title: \\\" + books[i]);\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }</pre>\\n<p>This array will print the titles in the reverse order. This is why its useful to learn both arrays depending on what you need to do with your array.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>Arrays With Methods</h3>\\n<p>As with all the other types you have learnt, arrays can be passed into and returned from methods.</p>\\n<p>Passing in arrays:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">    private static void usingArraysInMethods(String[] anotherStringArray) {\\r\\n        // arrays like other data types can be passed into methods and used\\r\\n\\r\\n        for (String book : anotherStringArray) {\\r\\n            System.out.println(\\\"Title: \\\" + book);\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }</pre>\\n<p>Passing in and returning arrays:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true \\\">    private static String[] returningArraysFromMethods(String[] anotherStringArray) {\\r\\n\\r\\n        // arrays like other data types can be passed into methods and also returned\\r\\n\\r\\n        for (String book : anotherStringArray) {\\r\\n            // lets make all items in the array lower case\\r\\n            book = book.toLowerCase();\\r\\n\\r\\n            System.out.println(\\\"Title: \\\" + book);\\r\\n        }\\r\\n        return anotherStringArray;\\r\\n    }</pre>\\n<p>The example above takes in the array makes all values lower case and returns the array.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>2D Arrays</h3>\\n<p>Are last example in the lesson is the Two Dimensional array. So far in this lesson we have just been using strings but you can use any type. We could create arrays of type int, boolean OR another array!</p>\\n<p>The easiest way to think of a 2D array is an array of arrays. Lets have a look at creating one:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">    private static void AnotherTwoDimensionalArray() {\\r\\n        String[][] books = {\\r\\n                {\\\"1984\\\", \\\"George Orwell\\\", \\\"£9.99\\\"},\\r\\n                {\\\"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\\\", \\\"Douglas Adams\\\", \\\"£9.99\\\"}};\\r\\n\\r\\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; books.length; i++) {\\r\\n\\r\\n            System.out.println(\\\"Title: \\\" + books[i][0] + \\\" Author: \\\" + books[i][1] + \\\" Price: \\\" + books[i][2]);\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }</pre>\\n<p>Creating the array you will see we use two groups of square brackets instead of one to declare a 2d array:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">String[][] books</pre>\\n<p>You will also see that when adding our values to the 2d array there are arrays inside of the main array:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">{\\r\\n    {\\\"1984\\\", \\\"George Orwell\\\", \\\"£9.99\\\"},\\r\\n    {\\\"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\\\", \\\"Douglas Adams\\\", \\\"£9.99\\\"}\\r\\n};</pre>\\n<p>Accessing values in the array is also different. We again need to use two square brackets with two numerical indexes:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang:java decode:true\\\">books[x][y]</pre>\\n<p>To explain this lets use another diagram:</p>\\n<p><a ref=\\\"magnificPopup\\\" href=\\\"https://www.ni-geeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter wp-image-752 size-large\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-1024x209.png\\\" alt=\\\"Screen Shot 2014-09-23 at 21.55.36\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"209\\\" srcset=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-1024x209.png 1024w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-300x61.png 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-768x157.png 768w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36-600x123.png 600w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36.png 1048w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a></p>\\n<p>As mentioned we can access a 2d with a two numerical indexes x and y in this case.

I have yet to need anything beyond 3 and I can only imagine that to require a 255d array you would need to be a physics genius!</p>\\n<p>As always try to get the code running and play around with it. See if you can iterate through the 2d array above and access the elements within it.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-9-reading-console-input/\\\">Next: Reading Console Input</a></h3>\\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation layout=&#8221;sided&#8221;][/vc_column][/vc_row]\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html-->[vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]Ok, In the last few lessons we learn&#8217;t how to use Conditional statements and loops which we are going to build upon in this lesson.

Imagine we had to declare a number of book titles for example. With the variables you&#8217;ve been taught in previous lessons we could write:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">        String title1 = \"a\";\r\n        String title2 = \"b\";\r\n        String title3 = \"c\";\r\n        String title4 = \"d\";</pre>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a bad solution if there are only 2 or 3 books but what if there&#8217;s ten or a hundred book&#8217;s? For this we are better using an array that can hold large numbers of related data.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<h3>Creating Arrays</h3>\n<p>Ok so let&#8217;s create one! First off let&#8217;s create a new class called Arrays.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]To create an array we use the following syntax:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">String[] books = {\"1984\", \"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\", \"Harry Potter\", \"A tale of two cities\"};</pre>\n<p>Here we have an array of four elements. The elements are of type String, there values are our book titles. To find out the length of an array we can use the .length variable contained inside an array object. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">System.out.println(\"There are \" + books.length + \" books in the array\");</pre>\n<p>Will output:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true \">\"There are 4 books in the array\"</pre>\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<h3>Accessing elements in Arrays</h3>\n<p>To access one of our titles we can use the elements numerical index. But first let me explain this a little more. To help do this I&#8217;m going to visualise the array we created above:</p>\n<p><a ref=\"magnificPopup\" href=\"https://www.ni-geeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-717 size-full alignleft\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png\" alt=\"arrays\" width=\"694\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"/content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17.png 694w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17-300x125.png 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-18.34.17-600x251.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An array consists of a number of elements. The number of elements depends on the number of values you inserted when you created the array. You should note that the first elements index is zero. So to access the first element in the array we would use:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true \">books[0]</pre>\n<p>Try it! Create our array above and use the following to print out the second element in the array:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true \">System.out.println(\"Our second title is: \" + books[1]);</pre>\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<h3>Iterating through Arrays</h3>\n<p>So now you&#8217;re able to extract values from the array which is great. But now were going to combine our knowledge of arrays with an older lesson on <a title=\"Lesson 6 – Loops\" href=\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/\">loops</a>. Iterating through an array is a very common pattern in programming and will be a very powerful tool to have. Lets look at the following code:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true \">    private static void iteratingThroughAnArray() {\r\n\r\n        String[] books = {\"1984\", \"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\", \"Harry Potter\", \"A tale of two cities\"};\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; books.length; i++) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Book \" + i + \" Title: \" + books[i]);\r\n        }\r\n    }</pre>\n<p>Add this method to your Arrays class and call it from your main method. You will see in the console output it will loop through every element in the array you created and print each title out.</p>\n<p>Whats interesting here is the use of the loops <em>i</em> variable. As the for loop steps through each loop, <em>i</em> is incremented. As you can see it starts at zero. Which is perfect for accessing the first element in the array. We also set the upper limit of the array to be <em>&lt; books.length. </em>This is very important! I encourage you to try to access an element in the array that doesn&#8217;t exist to see why! Try books[99] for example (Hint: You will see lots of red!).[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<h3>Reminder of the Java 5 Enhanced For loop</h3>\n<p>So now were going to remind ourselves of the enhanced for loop. We briefly covered this in the <a title=\"Lesson 6 – Loops\" href=\"https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-6-loops/\">loops lesson</a>. Lets have a look at another method which does the same thing as the previous example only using the enhanced loop:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true \">    private static void usingTheEnhancedForLoop() {\r\n\r\n        String[] books = {\"1984\", \"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\", \"Harry Potter\", \"A tale of two cities\"};\r\n\r\n        for (String book : books) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Title: \" + book);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }</pre>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see from the output this is (almost) the same method as before. An advantage however is the i variable and the books.length are not required. This is therefore less prone to errors (like the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException you would have seen if you&#8217;d tried to access an element that doesn&#8217;t exist).</p>\n<p>It also has a few drawbacks. You cannot access the numerical index of the current element in the array because there is no i variable and also these loops can only go in one direction. In the previous loop you could have declared your array like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">    private static void iteratingThroughAnArray_backwards() {\r\n\r\n        String[] books = {\"1984\", \"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\", \"Harry Potter\", \"A tale of two cities\"};\r\n\r\n        for (int i = books.length -1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Book \" + i + \" Title: \" + books[i]);\r\n        }\r\n    }</pre>\n<p>This array will print the titles in the reverse order. This is why its useful to learn both arrays depending on what you need to do with your array.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<h3>Arrays With Methods</h3>\n<p>As with all the other types you have learnt, arrays can be passed into and returned from methods.</p>\n<p>Passing in arrays:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true\">    private static void usingArraysInMethods(String[] anotherStringArray) {\r\n        // arrays like other data types can be passed into methods and used\r\n\r\n        for (String book : anotherStringArray) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Title: \" + book);\r\n        }\r\n    }</pre>\n<p>Passing in and returning arrays:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java decode:true \">    private static String[] returningArraysFromMethods(String[] anotherStringArray) {\r\n\r\n        // arrays like other data types can be passed into methods and also returned\r\n\r\n        for (String book : anotherStringArray) {\r\n            // lets make all items in the array lower case\r\n            book = book.toLowerCase();\r\n\r\n            System.out.println(\"Title: \" + book);\r\n        }\r\n        return anotherStringArray;\r\n    }</pre>\n<p>The example above takes in the array makes all values lower case and returns the array.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<h3>2D Arrays</h3>\n<p>Are last example in the lesson is the Two Dimensional array.

This is why its useful to\nlearn both arrays depending on what you need to do with your\narray.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nArrays With Methods\nAs with all the other types you have learnt, arrays can be passed into and\nreturned from methods.\n\nPassing in arrays:\n\n    private static void usingArraysInMethods(String[] anotherStringArray) {\r\n        // arrays like other data types can be passed into methods and used\r\n\r\n        for (String book : anotherStringArray) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Title: \" + book);\r\n        }\r\n    }\n\nPassing in and returning arrays:\n\n    private static String[] returningArraysFromMethods(String[] anotherStringArray) {\r\n\r\n        // arrays like other data types can be passed into methods and also returned\r\n\r\n        for (String book : anotherStringArray) {\r\n            // lets make all items in the array lower case\r\n            book = book.toLowerCase();\r\n\r\n            System.out.println(\"Title: \" + book);\r\n        }\r\n        return anotherStringArray;\r\n    }\n\nThe example above takes in the array makes all values lower case and returns the\narray.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\n2D Arrays\nAre last example in the lesson is the Two Dimensional array. So far in this\nlesson we have just been using strings but you can use any type. We could create\narrays of type int, boolean OR another array!\n\nThe easiest way to think of a 2D array is an array of arrays. Lets have a look\nat creating one:\n\n    private static void AnotherTwoDimensionalArray() {\r\n        String[][] books = {\r\n                {\"1984\", \"George Orwell\", \"£9.99\"},\r\n                {\"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\", \"Douglas Adams\", \"£9.99\"}};\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {\r\n\r\n            System.out.println(\"Title: \" + books[i][0] + \" Author: \" + books[i][1] + \" Price: \" + books[i][2]);\r\n        }\r\n    }\n\nCreating the array you will see we use two groups of square brackets instead of\none to declare a 2d array:\n\nString[][] books\n\nYou will also see that when adding our values to the 2d array there are arrays\ninside of the main array:\n\n{\r\n    {\"1984\", \"George Orwell\", \"£9.99\"},\r\n    {\"Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy\", \"Douglas Adams\", \"£9.99\"}\r\n};\n\nAccessing values in the array is also different. We again need to use two square\nbrackets with two numerical indexes:\n\nbooks[x][y]\n\nTo explain this lets use another diagram:\n\n \n[https://www.ni-geeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-09-23-at-21.55.36.png]\n\nAs mentioned we can access a 2d with a two numerical indexes x and y in this\ncase. The diagram shows the x index accessing the first element in the outside\narray and the y accessing an element in the array that is referred to by x.\n\nSurprisingly the java spec limits the amount of dimensions you can create on an\narray to 255! I have yet to need anything beyond 3 and I can only imagine that\nto require a 255d array you would need to be a physics genius!\n\nAs always try to get the code running and play around with it. See if you can\niterate through the 2d array above and access the elements within\nit.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nNext: Reading Console Input\n[https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-9-reading-console-input/]\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation\nlayout=”sided”][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2019/04/array-bright-cloth-5872.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2019-04-04 18:20:27","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2020-06-09 20:35:32","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2019-04-04 18:20:27","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aed8","uuid":"fdd39578-2a02-44c8-bc61-2b57820ad759","title":"Lesson 9 - Reading console input and import statements","slug":"lesson-9-reading-console-input","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]\\n<p>Ok, In this short double lesson we are going to learn how to read input into our program from the console and use some new features from another java package using an import statement.</p>\\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][us_iconbox icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221; size=&#8221;48px&#8221; iconpos=&#8221;left&#8221; title=&#8221;Downloads&#8221; alignment=&#8221;left&#8221;]To get started you can use the basic <a href=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/StarterProject.zip\\\">starter project</a> and follow the steps to compile the code examples for the lesson.[/us_iconbox][us_separator show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|code&#8221;][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]\\n<h3>Reading basic input</h3>\\n<p>The first thing we are going to look at is reading in a string from the console view in our IDE using a Buffered reader.

Exceptions will be covered extensively in\nthe intermediate tutorials.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nOk lets continue\nWether using Eclipse or IntelliJ have a look at the short video clips below on\nhow to run the code and enter some\ninput:[/vc_column_text][vc_tta_tabs][vc_tta_section active=”1″\ntitle=”Eclipse”][vc_video\nlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltvamMqTPrg&hd=1″][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section\ntitle=”IntelliJ”][vc_video\nlink=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3wo7bc-bmU&hd=1″][/vc_tta_section][/vc_tta_tabs][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nSo what are these new classes doing?\nSystem.in\nThis is the standard input stream for any incoming data. This stream by default\nis open and ready to read input once declared. The most common use of\nthis stream is to capture keyboard input or user input.\n\nInputStreamReader\nAn InputStreamReader converts byte streams to character streams.\n\nBufferedReader\nLastly, the BufferedRedaer reads text from a character-input stream (in out case\nan InputStreamReader), buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient\nreading of characters.\n\nreadLine() simply reads a line of text.[/vc_column_text][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nAnother example of reading input\nLets take another example for reading in a string and converting it to an\ninteger. Copy the following code to your example. You can replace the code under\nthe buffered reader or just add it below the previous example:\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter an Integer: \");\r\n        int i = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());\r\n        System.out.println(\"You entered \" + i);\n\nThis time when running the example enter a number. You will see that the input\nis converted to an Integer using the parseInt method which is inside the Integer\nclass (The Integer class is part of the java.lang package so no need for any\nimports).\n\nAlthough we are not covering exceptions until the next lesson series I would\nalso encourage you to run this example and input a string which is not a number.\nYou will see an example of a possible ‘Exception’.\n\nFor more examples see my course downloads\n[https://www.codenerve.com/product/beginner-java-source-code/]\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nNext up: Date & Time library\n[https://www.codenerve.com/beginner-java/lesson-10-date-time-api/]\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation\nlayout=”sided”][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2014/10/console-controller-gamer-21067.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2019-04-06 22:36:30","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2020-06-09 20:36:47","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2019-04-06 22:36:30","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aed9","uuid":"828ee16e-6b3a-4300-8673-8ce21a933a43","title":"Search Results Page","slug":"search-results-page","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"[vc_row][vc_column][us_grid post_type=&#8221;current_query&#8221; items_layout=&#8221;blog_cards&#8221; columns=&#8221;4&#8243; img_size=&#8221;us_600_600_crop&#8221;][/vc_column][/vc_row]\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html-->[vc_row][vc_column][us_grid post_type=&#8221;current_query&#8221; items_layout=&#8221;blog_cards&#8221; columns=&#8221;4&#8243; img_size=&#8221;us_600_600_crop&#8221;][/vc_column][/vc_row]\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->","comment_id":"2082","plaintext":"[vc_row][vc_column][us_grid post_type=”current_query” items_layout=”blog_cards”\ncolumns=”4″ img_size=”us_600_600_crop”][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"page","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2019-04-07 13:41:00","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2019-04-14 15:04:06","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2019-04-07 13:41:00","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aeda","uuid":"38b017f0-fa80-4157-815a-78281410d520","title":"Lesson 10 - New Date & Time Library","slug":"lesson-10-date-time-api","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]\\n<p>Ok, In this lesson we will cover the Java date &amp; time library.

For this reason many developers choose to use another library\ncalled Joda time instead of the default classes.\n\nThankfully Joda’s approach has now been taken onboard and a new Date and Time\nlibrary has been created in java 8.\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_message type=”info”]What is a library?\n\nA library is a collection of prewritten classes which can be specified and used\nby a programmer when developing a program\n[/us_message][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]Ok,\nlets start to learn the main classes of the new Date and Time Library.\n\nClock\nThe easiest way to get the time ‘right now’ is with the Clock class.\n\nClock clock = Clock.systemUTC();\n\nNotice that we don’t use the newkeyword. This is because this class is known as \nabstractwhich means we cant create (or instantiate) it. Instead we use special\nmethods which return copies of Clocks to us.\n\nsystemUTC() is a method which returns the date and time ‘right now’ using the\nUTC timezone.\n\nUTC – the time standard used commonly across the world. The world’s timing\ncenters have agreed to keep their time scales closely synchronized – or\ncoordinated – therefore the name Coordinated Universal Time.\n\nTo use the default time zone on the machine the code is being run on we can also\nuse systemDefaultZone().\n\nClock clock2 = Clock.systemDefaultZone();\n\nIt is important to realise that this has a dependency to the timezone the\nmachine running your code is set to. Java recommends that instead you explicitly\nstate which timezone you want to be in. This way the behaviour of your code will\nnot change if you’re running the program in different locations of the\nworld.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nLocalDateTime\nThe LocalDateTime class is a time without a timezone. This class is simply a way\nto describe a date and does not represent an actual exact time anywhere. We use\nit to describe a date and time such as a birthday or anniversaries.\n\nThere are many ways to create these. Here are some examples:\n\nLocalDateTime localDateTime = LocalDateTime.now();\r\n\r\nlocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 12, 25, 12, 50);\r\nlocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 12, 25, 12, 50, 51);\r\nlocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 12, 25, 12, 50, 51, 19000);\r\nlocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, Month.DECEMBER, 25, 12, 50);\r\nlocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, Month.DECEMBER, 25, 12, 50, 51);\r\nlocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, Month.DECEMBER, 25, 12, 50, 51, 19000);\r\nlocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.of( Year.now().getValue(), Month.FEBRUARY, DayOfWeek.SATURDAY.getValue(), 1, 1, 1 );\n\nYou’ll notice that again we do not use the new keyword. Instead we use special\nhelper methods to create the LocalDateTime for us. You’ll also notice in the\nlast few examples that we have other helper classes/methods we can use to create\nYears, Months and DayOfWeeks for us.\n\nFor a full list of the parameters we pass to the of method above practice\ncreating LocalDateTimes in your IDE with auto complete and/or use Oracle’s\nofficial documentation\n[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDateTime.html#of-int-int-int-int-int-]\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nLocalDate\nLocalDate is similar to LocalDateTime but with out the time or timezone. To\ncreate this we have various methods we can use on the LocalDate class:\n\nLocalDate date = LocalDate.now();\r\nLocalDate ofDate = LocalDate.of(2014,1,1);\r\nLocalDate epochDate = LocalDate.ofEpochDay(0l);\n\nAgain this can be used for things like birthdays and other dates that do not\nrequire times or timezones.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nLocalTime\nConversely, LocalTime is similar to LocalDateTime but with out the Date or\ntimezone added. To create this we have various methods we can use on the\nLocalTime class:\n\nLocalTime timeNow = LocalTime.now();\r\nLocalTime timeOf = LocalTime.of(12, 00);\n\nAll of the above classes (LocalDateTime, LocalDate and LocalTime) cannot be used\nto find an exact point in time due to there lack of timezone functionality. So\nthese are just used to represent date and times in a human readable\nway.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]\n\nInstant\nTo represent an exact point in time we can use the Instant class:\n\nInstant instant = Instant.now();\n\nYou can also convert Strings into Instants:\n\ninstant = Instant.parse(\"2015-11-20T11:10:59Z\");\n\n\n\n\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]As\nalways play around with the examples and try to use them in your own basic\nprogram.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Next: Primitive types vs wrapper\nclasses\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][us_post_navigation\nlayout=”sided” in_same_term=”1″][/vc_column][/vc_row]","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2019/04/background-black-and-white-blackboard-745365.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","created_at":"2019-04-07 21:02:25","created_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","updated_at":"2020-06-09 20:39:22","updated_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","published_at":"2019-04-07 21:02:25","published_by":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aebd","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f1203ad07a62a995513aedb","uuid":"fd5dc2eb-1be5-408f-a0a8-f8fef1203622","title":"Spring Security - Basic Login Form","slug":"spring-security-basic-login-form","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\\n<h2>Welcome!</h2>\\n<p>In this series, I hope to show you some techniques for using spring security and the broader spring ecosystem to build and develop secure application web servers.</p>\\n<p>Today, we&#8217;ll be looking at building a basic login form page using:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Spring Boot</li>\\n<li>Spring Security, and</li>\\n<li>Thymeleaf</li>\\n</ul>\\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row height=&#8221;auto&#8221;][vc_column][us_cta title=&#8221;Sample Code&#8221; color=&#8221;secondary&#8221; btn_label=&#8221;Code&#8221; btn_link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMWhyte%2Fspring-security%2Ftree%2F1.basic-form-login||target:%20_blank|&#8221; btn_style=&#8221;2&#8243; btn_size=&#8221;15px&#8221; btn_icon=&#8221;fab|github&#8221;]The code for this lesson is available on GitHub[/us_cta][us_separator size=&#8221;small&#8221; show_line=&#8221;1&#8243; icon=&#8221;fas|leaf&#8221;][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row css=&#8221;%7B%22default%22%3A%7B%22margin-top%22%3A%220px%22%2C%22border-top-width%22%3A%220px%22%2C%22padding-top%22%3A%220px%22%7D%7D&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]First off lets briefly cover some of the project files that are of less interest:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Application.java &#8211; contains our main method and the <em>@SpringBootApplication </em>annotation.</li>\\n<li>A CSS stylesheet is located under src/main/resources/static/css/ to make the demo pretty</li>\\n<li>Some Thymeleaf HTML templates are located under src/main/resources/ for demo purposes also.</li>\\n<li>An application.properties file is located under src/main/resources where we can pass configuration parameters to our spring boot application.

In this series, I hope to show you some techniques for using spring\nsecurity and the larger spring ecosystem to build and develop secure application\nweb servers.\n\nSo far we’ve built a basic spring boot application, enabled spring security and\nbuilt a basic login form\n[https://www.codenerve.com/spring-security-basic-login-form/]. In the last\nlesson, we expanded on the first lesson by adding different user roles and the\nability to show and hide front-end content based on these roles (User Roles and\nThymeleaf Extras). [https://www.codenerve.com/spring-security-thymeleaf-extras/]\n\nToday, we’ll be looking at redirecting users with different roles to different\npages after they log in.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row\nheight=”auto”][vc_column][us_cta title=”Sample Code” color=”secondary”\nbtn_label=”Code”\nbtn_link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMWhyte%2Fspring-security%2Ftree%2F3.redirect-based-on-role||target:%20_blank|”\nbtn_style=”2″ btn_size=”15px” btn_icon=”fab|github”]The code for this lesson is\navailable on GitHub[/us_cta][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row\ncss=”%7B%22default%22%3A%7B%22margin-top%22%3A%220px%22%2C%22border-top-width%22%3A%220px%22%2C%22padding-top%22%3A%220px%22%7D%7D”][vc_column][us_separator\nshow_line=”1″ icon=”fas|leaf”][vc_column_text]Some files are already set up for\nyou from the previous lesson:Spring Security – User Roles and Thymeleaf Extras\n[https://www.codenerve.com/spring-security-thymeleaf-extras/]. Please start here\nor check out the complete code from the link\nabove.[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|leaf”][vc_column_text el_id=”mrwhyte”]\n\nAdmin.html\nFrom our previous example, we have created a new HTML file called Admin.html.\nThis is the page we will redirect admins to when they log in.\n\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:th=\"http://www.thymeleaf.org\"\r\n      xmlns:sec=\"http://www.thymeleaf.org/thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity4\">\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n    <title>codenerve.com - Welcome!</title>\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n    <title>Admin</title>\r\n    <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/style.css\">\r\n</head>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <h1 th:inline=\"text\">Hello [[${#httpServletRequest.remoteUser}]]!</h1>\r\n\r\n        <div>\r\n             Custom administrator page.\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <form th:action=\"@{/logout}\" method=\"post\">\r\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign Out\"/>\r\n        </form>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|leaf”][vc_column_text]\nMvcConfig\nNow, to serve the new admin.html page, we must add this page to our MvcConfig.\n\nAs with the previous examples, this is done by creating a class,\nextending WebMvcConfigurerAdapter and overriding the addViewControllers method.\nThis time adding all the earlier pages of our app and the new admin page:\n\n@Configuration\r\npublic class MvcConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void addViewControllers(ViewControllerRegistry registry) {\r\n        registry.addViewController(\"/\").setViewName(\"login\");\r\n        registry.addViewController(\"/index\").setViewName(\"index\");\r\n        registry.addViewController(\"/admin\").setViewName(\"admin\");\r\n        registry.addViewController(\"/login\").setViewName(\"login\");\r\n    }\r\n}\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|leaf”][vc_column_text]\nWebSecurityConfig\nThe Constructor\nIn order to decide what to do when different user roles login. We have created a\nnew field of type AuthenticationSuccessHandler. We’re setting this new\nconfiguration bean via constructor injection.\n\nconfigure method\nThis method is in charge of overriding and configuring HttpSecurity explicitly.\nFrom the last example, we have added two lines.\n\nFirst, we’ve added a new antMatcher under the authorizeRequests section, and\nwe’ve told spring security only to allow a user with the ‘ADMIN’ role access to\nall endpoints starting with ‘/admin’:\n\n.antMatchers(\"/admin\").hasRole(\"ADMIN\")\n\nSecondly, we’ve added our CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler under the formLogin\nsection to tell spring security to ask this CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler\nwhat to do when a successful login occurs:\n\n.successHandler(authenticationSuccessHandler)\n\nconfigureGlobal method\nThe configureGlobal method is our in-memory registry of users. We’ve added two\nusers. One with the primary ‘USER’ role and the other with the ‘ADMIN’ role.\n\nFull example:\n@Configuration\r\n@EnableWebSecurity\r\npublic class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\r\n\r\n    private AuthenticationSuccessHandler authenticationSuccessHandler;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public WebSecurityConfig(AuthenticationSuccessHandler authenticationSuccessHandler) {\r\n        this.authenticationSuccessHandler = authenticationSuccessHandler;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n        http\r\n                .authorizeRequests()\r\n                .antMatchers( \"/css/**\").permitAll()\r\n                .antMatchers(\"/admin\").hasRole(\"ADMIN\")\r\n                .anyRequest().authenticated()\r\n                .and()\r\n                .formLogin()\r\n                .loginPage(\"/login\")\r\n                .successHandler(authenticationSuccessHandler)\r\n                .permitAll()\r\n                .and()\r\n                .logout()\r\n                .permitAll()\r\n                .and().csrf().disable(); // we'll enable this in a later blog post\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {\r\n        auth\r\n                .inMemoryAuthentication()\r\n                .withUser(\"user\").password(\"pass\").roles(\"USER\")\r\n                .and()\r\n                .withUser(\"admin\").password(\"pass\").roles(\"ADMIN\");\r\n    }\r\n}\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|leaf”][vc_column_text]\nCustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler\nAs you can see from our sample code below this class implements spring\nAuthenticationSuccessHandler class and overrides the onAuthenticationSuccess\nmethod.\n\nOnce a user is successfully logged in, this method is called and within this\nmethod, the user’s role is checked. If the user’s role is admin we redirect to\nthe ‘/admin’ HTTP endpoint otherwise we redirect them to the ‘/index’ endpoint.\n\nAt this point, our MvcConfig takes over and serves the correct HTML page based\non the viewController we created previously.\n\n@Configuration\r\npublic class CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler implements AuthenticationSuccessHandler {\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onAuthenticationSuccess(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse, Authentication authentication) throws IOException, ServletException {\r\n\r\n        Set<String> roles = AuthorityUtils.authorityListToSet(authentication.getAuthorities());\r\n\r\n        if (roles.contains(\"ROLE_ADMIN\")) {\r\n            httpServletResponse.sendRedirect(\"/admin\");\r\n        } else {\r\n            httpServletResponse.sendRedirect(\"/index\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\n\n\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator show_line=”1″ icon=”fas|leaf”][vc_column_text]\nDemo\nTo run the demo, open theApplication class and right-click run.

It is also important to note that this method is non-deterministic and\ncan return different results if run multiple times.\n\nThis example finds any Robert Martin book:\n\n    @Test\r\n    void find_a_robert_martin_book() {\r\n        Optional<Book> aRobertMartinBook = books.stream()\r\n                .filter(book -> book.getAuthor().contains(\"Martin Fowler\"))\r\n                .findAny();\r\n\r\n        assertThat(aRobertMartinBook.get().getAuthor(), is(equalTo(\"Martin Fowler\")));\r\n    }\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=”small” show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]orElse\nAn alternative to returning an optional from a findAny() call is to use \norElse(….). This allows us to return a default value if there are no matches in\nthe stream.\n\nThis example returns a Martin Fowler book if it exists in the collection or null\nif nothing is found:\n\n    @Test\r\n    void find_a_martin_fowler_book() {\r\n        Book aMartinFowlerBook = books.stream()\r\n                .filter(book -> book.getAuthor().contains(\"Martin Fowler\"))\r\n                .findAny()\r\n                .orElse(null);\r\n\r\n        assertThat(aMartinFowlerBook.getAuthor(), is(equalTo(\"Martin Fowler\")));\r\n    }\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=”small” show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]findFirst\nThe findFirst() method finds the first element in a Stream. Unlike findAny(…) it\nis deterministic.\n\nThis example finds the first Marting Fowler book in the stream or returns null:\n\n    @Test\r\n    void find_the_first_martin_fowler_book() {\r\n        Book aMartinFowlerBook = books.stream()\r\n                .filter(book -> book.getAuthor().contains(\"Martin Fowler\"))\r\n                .findFirst()\r\n                .orElse(null);\r\n\r\n        assertThat(aMartinFowlerBook.getTitle(), is(equalTo(\"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture\")));\r\n    }\n\n[/vc_column_text][us_separator size=”small” show_line=”1″\nicon=”fas|code”][vc_column_text]orElseThrow\nSimilar to orElse but instead of returning a default value if nothing is found\nin the stream throw and exception.\n\nThis example looks a book written by codenerve and returns an exception if one\ndoes not exist:\n\n    @Test\r\n    void find_codenerves_awesome_book() {\r\n        assertThrows(Exception.class, () ->\r\n                books.stream()\r\n                        .filter(book -> book.getAuthor().contains(\"Codenerve\"))\r\n                        .findFirst()\r\n                        .orElseThrow(() -> new Exception(\"Codenerve hasn't written any good books yet :-(\")));\r\n    }\n\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section icon=”fas|map”\ntab_id=”1593167228716-e014acf1-3e5d”\ntitle=”Map”][/vc_tta_section][/vc_tta_tour][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\nBasic Operations on Maps\nI am text block.
